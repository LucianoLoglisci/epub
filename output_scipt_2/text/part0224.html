			<p class="caption3">Is 23…Na4 a good idea?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black sacrificed a pawn for a burst of activity and now had to choose between 23…Na4, winning the Exchange, and 23…Be6, developing and forcing White to deal with the threat against c4. Be it good or bad, he should have given 23…Be6 the nod since his pieces become extremely active (lines like 23…Be6 24.Bf1 d5 25.cxd5 cxd5 26.e5 Nc4 lead to very interesting positions).</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: 23…Na4 wins material, but that in itself doesn’t make it good. I think 23…Na4 would have been very tempting for players under 1800.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game, Black couldn’t resist <span class="bold">23…Na4 24.Nxa4 </span>(24.e5 Nxc3 25.Qxc3 Qe7 26.Rxd6 Qxd6)<span class="bold"> 24…Bxa1</span> when <span class="bold">25.e5</span> slammed the door shut on black’s whole game: <span class="bold">25…Be6 26.Rxd6 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">It’s time to take stock: Black played for the win of the Exchange and ended up getting his wish. Unfortunately, White was granted far too many favorable imbalances in return. Is an overwhelming space advantage in the center and on the queenside worth something? How about the monster Rook on d6? Two laser-beam Bishops? The fact that black’s pieces aren’t doing anything (Rooks are only worthwhile if they have open files to patrol) seems important. And what about that poor Bishop on a1? Is it ever going to get out alive? Finally, Black isn’t even up material since White has two pawns for the Exchange. In other words, it’s a complete disaster for the second player.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Moral? Don’t play for the win of material unless you’ve carefully sized up any and all compensating factors the opponent will get in return!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The rest of the game was a slaughter: <span class="bold">26…Qc7 27.Nc5 Rad8 28.Nxe6 Rxe6 29.c5 Rde8 30.Kh2 Qe7 31.Qd1 Bxe5 32.Rd7 Qf6 33.fxe5 Qxe5 34.Qf3 f5 35.Bd4 Qe1 36.Rg7+ Kf8 37.Qf4 R6e7 38.Qh6</span>, 1-0.</p>
