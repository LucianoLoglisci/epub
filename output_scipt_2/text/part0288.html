			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If you said, “No, it doesn’t make any sense because the Bishop is nothing more than a Tall-Pawn on b2.” then I would applaud you for not wanting to waste a developing move to put a Bishop on a square that you deem to be a dead end street. Your answer isn’t correct, but it does show some real chess understanding and I would be happy with any student under 1900 that answered in this way.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The key to this problem is the realization that black’s main pawn break is …e6-e5. If you understood this, then you also understood that Bb2 would prove useful at some point in the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The truth is that 8.Bb2 is very sensible (in fact, it’s white’s most popular move here). Yes, it does look like a Tall-Pawn on that square, and if Bb2 was simply a “let me develop it somewhere” kind of move, then it would be open to serious criticism. However, 8.Bb2 actually demonstrates a deep understanding of not only white’s possibilities, but also the opponent’s. Remember, you need to know the ideas for both sides. Thus, if Black doesn’t want to suffocate due to his lack of space, he’ll eventually have to play …e6-e5. When that happens, White will capture on e5 and turn the “Tall-Pawn” into a very fine piece.</p>

Bologan - A. Grischuk, Poikovsky 2004, and White, who will follow up with Ne1-c2-d4, has the more pleasant position.</p>
