			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold"> 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Nf3 0–0 5.g3 d6 6.Bg2 Nbd7 7.0–0 e5 8.h3 exd4 9.Nxd4 Nb6 10.b3 d5 11.c5 Nbd7 12.c6 Ne5 13.cxb7 Bxb7 14.Ba3 Re8 15.Rc1 a6 16.Na4 Ne4 17.Nc5 Nxc5 18.Bxc5 Nd7 19.e3 Nxc5 20.Rxc5 Bf8 21.Rc2 c5 22.Ne2 Qd7 23.Rd2 Rad8 24.Bxd5 Bxd5 25.Nf4</span> - Diagram 414</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Girl-brain is battling a monster! Christiansen (who was playing a clock simultaneous) is a three time U.S. Champion and is known as the greatest American attacking player since the legendary Frank Marshall. Most players would wilt in the face of such firepower, but girl-brain has managed to hold her own. However, now the heat is on since her Bishop’s pinned and, if it falls, she’ll be down a pawn for nothing.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you saw black’s correct 25th move, congratulations. However, if you defended the Bishop, thus allowing the curse of “I have to” to tell you what to do, then you should go back and reacquaint yourself with Part Four, Overcoming the Trap of “I Can’t” and “I Must”.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here’s how the game went with girl-brain’s comments:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Re5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">“I had to defend my Bishop so my move was forced.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.e4 Bh6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">“Trying to mix things up a bit. Of course, I can’t play 26…Rxe4 27.Rxd5 Bd6 28.Qd3 Ree8 because 29.Rd1 kills me.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">27.Rxd5 Rxd5 28.Nxd5 Qe6 29.Qd3 </span>and White, who is now a safe pawn ahead, went on to win the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Did you notice that Black was swimming in the world of “I can’t” and “I have to”? First off, take a look at her comment to 26…Bh6 where she states that she can’t play 26…Rxe4. Of course, that’s the move Black would <span class="italic">like</span> to play since it would regain her lost pawn. But, instead of staring at it and trying to make it work by dint of pure willpower (since if it doesn’t work, you’re pretty much going to lose), she simply accepted her fate. What’s the truth about 26…Rxe4? Let’s give it a closer look:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Rxe4 27.Rxd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">27.Nxd5 Kh8 is fine for Black.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">27…Bd6 28.Qd3 Rd4 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">There’s a lot going on here!</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.Qxa6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">29.Rxd4 cxd4 30.Qxd4 Bxf4 31.Qxf4 (31.Qxd7 Rxd7 32.gxf4 Rd2, =) 31…Qxh3 32.Qf6 Qc8, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Rxd5 30.Nxd5 Qxh3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">30…Kg7!? 31.Kg2 Be5 32.Rd1 h5 is still a fight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">31.Qb6 Bxg3! 32.Qxd8+ Kg7 33.Qf6+ Kh6</span> is a draw. Sadly, 31.Qa5! is stronger since 31…Bxg3 no longer works: 32.Ne7+ Kg7 33.Qc3+ wins for White. This means that Black has to try something like 31.Qa5 Rc8 32.Nf6+ Kh8 33.Qc3 Bf8! and, though white’s still considerably better after 34.Re1, Black can still put up resistance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Is that the end of the story? No, going back to the position after 26…Rxe4 27.Rxd5 Bd6 28.Qd3 Ree8 29.Rd1 we recall that Black said the Rook move to d1, “kills me,” but a better attitude might have helped her notice 29…Qc6! </p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 414b</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black’s alive after all!</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A look with a tactical eye will tell you that the “killing” 30.Rxd6?? (30.Qc4! allows White to retain an edge, but nothing too terrifying) actually loses to 30…Rxd6 31.Qxd6 Re1+! 32.Rxe1 Qxd6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">All this is extremely complicated and, to be honest, beyond most player’s analytical ability. However, it shows that there was a whole world hiding behind girl-brain’s “I can’t” and, if you don’t look and insist, you’ll never come close to finding that hidden trove of unnoticed possibilities that will turn a certain loss into something a lot more upbeat.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I should add that this whole defensive nightmare began with her comment on the 25th move: “I <span class="italic">had to</span> defend my Bishop so my move (25…Re5) was forced.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">But, this turns out to be completely untrue!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">25…Bxb3! </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 414c</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Who said Black was worse?</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">26.Rxd7 Bxd1 27.Rfxd1 Rxd7 28.Rxd7 Rc8</span> and black’s the only one (thanks to the passed c-pawn) who can even consider playing for a win. 25…Bxb3 doesn’t seem that complicated or hard to discover, but it’s impossible to find if you start out by saying, “I have to defend my Bishop!”</p>
