			<h3 class="chapter-descripton">Learning the ABCs</h3>
			<p class="chapter-quote">“A sound plan makes us all heroes, the absence of a plan, idiots.”<br class="calibre3"/>—G.M. Kotov, quoting a mysterious “chess sage.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At some time or other every tournament player learns a few opening lines, some tactical ideas, the most basic mating patterns, and a few elementary endgames. As he gets better and more experienced, he significantly adds to this knowledge. However, the one thing that just about everybody has problems with is planning. From class “E” (under 1200) to Master, I get blank stares when asking what plan they had in mind in a particular position. Usually their choice of a plan (if they have any plan at all) is based on emotional rather than chess-specific considerations. By emotional, I mean that the typical player does what he <span class="italic">feels</span> like doing rather than what the board is <span class="italic">telling</span> him to do. This somewhat cryptic sentence leads us to the following extremely important concept: If you want to be successful, you have to base your moves and plans on the specific imbalance-oriented criteria that exist in the given position, not on your mood, tastes, and/or fears!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Literally every non-master’s games are filled with examples of “imbalance avoidance.” Beginners, of course, simply don’t know what imbalances are. Most experienced players have heard the term and perhaps have even tried to make use of them from time to time; however, once the rush of battle takes over, isolated moves and raw aggression (or terror, if you find yourself defending) push any and all thoughts of imbalances out the door. In this case, chess becomes an empty move-by-move, threat-by-threat (either making them or responding to them) affair.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What is this mysterious allusion to the chessboard’s desires (i.e., doing what the chessboard wants you to do)? What are these “imbalance-oriented criteria” that we are going to have to become aware of, and how do we master their use? What, exactly, is a plan? To answer these questions, the first thing we have to do is understand that an imbalance is any significant difference in the two respective positions.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This sounds rather vacuous. How can such a simplistic thing be important? The answer is that it’s far from simplistic, and that this easy-to-grasp concept allows any player from 1400 on up to understand most positions in a basic but logical fashion. In other words, where a position may have looked much too complex to fathom, the imbalances deconstruct it in a way that makes it user friendly.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s a simple example: if one side has more queenside space while the other side is staring at his opponent’s weak pawn, those are the imbalances that delineate the moves and plans that both players would follow. In effect, the imbalances act as a roadmap that shows each side what to do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The following list of the imbalances will be discussed all through this book:</p>

My ultimate goal is to train your mind to embrace “Imbalance Consciousness”—a state where the use of imbalances becomes a natural and often unconscious process.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Compare white’s Bishop, which is eyeing two position-penetrating diagonals, and black’s slacker Knight, and you’ll immediately know which minor piece is winning this battle. When we add other imbalances into the equation—White has an advantage in both central and queenside space, a target on a7 (which can be gobbled up by Ra1-b1-b7), and chances to mate (after Bc3 followed by Qd4) black’s vulnerable King—one could understand if Black chose this moment to resign.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s Bishop, which is caged and useless, is no match for white’s Knight, which is the ruler of the known universe. Combined with other favorable white imbalances—central, queenside, and kingside space, control of the hole on e6, and (after Ra1-b1-b7) pressure against a7 and c7—Black would be well advised to resign as quickly as possible.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is a pawn up and he has two passed pawns to white’s one passer. Yet, Black can resign! The reason? White’s passed pawn is further advanced and all his pieces are working with the pawn to make sure it scores a touchdown on b8: <span class="bold">1.b7 </span>(Threatening to win a whole Rook with 2.b8=Q.) <span class="bold">1…Rb8 2.Bxb8 Rxb8 3.Qc6 Qd8 </span>(No better is 3…Qxc6+ 4.Rxc6 Be5 5.Rc8+ Kg7 6.f4 Bd6 7.Rxb8 Bxb8 8.Ra1 d3 9.Kf3 stopping any d-pawn nonsense and intending Rxa6 followed by Ra8) <span class="bold">4.Qc8 Be5 5.Qxd8+ Rxd8 6.Rc8</span>, 1-0.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has a weak, isolated pawn on e6. Naturally, White dedicated his game plan to going after it. Thus far, white’s Queen and Rooks are piling on the pressure but, since chess is a team game, he’s not done yet! <span class="bold">1.Bh3</span> (A fourth white piece enters the assault against e6) <span class="bold">1…Nd8 2.Ng5</span> (The entrance of this fifth white piece into the battle for e6 dooms black’s pawn.) <span class="bold">2…Bb8? </span>(This allows a trick that makes black’s game even worse) <span class="bold">3.f5! gxf5 4. Bxf5 </span>and e6 will still fall, but now black’s King is sitting in “open air” (another imbalance White can use!).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A nightmare for Black, who is so cramped that he’s gasping for air! White has claimed an appreciable advantage in space in virtually every sector. Note how black’s lack of wiggle room leaves his pieces in a tight little box, while white’s are happy free range pieces. In such positions the side with this much extra space will almost certainly win if he can find a way to break into enemy territory. Here White, who enjoys a wealth of riches, can accomplish this by preparing a queenside entry via c4-c5, or a kingside slaughter via g4-g5 (both pawn advances dare to demand even <span class="italic">more </span>space!). Thus, logical moves would be 1.c5, 1.g5, 1.Rcg1, or 1.Rh1.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White is solid, but Black seems to have a nice, active position. If black’s c-pawn was on c6 he wouldn’t have any problems at all, but it’s still on c7 and that gives White the chance to embrace his inner greed and claim a material imbalance: <span class="bold">1.Bxb7! </span>(Taking this pawn does a number of useful things: It gives White “endgame odds”—annoying for Black since the more pieces the materially challenged side trades, the closer to a pawn up endgame victory White gets; it creates a hole on c6 which allows White to grab control of the central light squares along the h1-a8 diagonal; it places great psychological pressure on Black who now has to get something going in an effort to justify the lost pawn.)<span class="bold"> 1…Kh8</span> (Black would love to take advantage of the errant white Bishop, but nothing works: 1…c6 2.Qc4+ picks up the c6-pawn; 1…Bg4 2.Qc4+ [2.f3 is also strong] 2…Kh8 3.Bc6 [3.Rd4 is a nice alternative] 3…Qf5 4.Rd2 intending f2-f4 when Black doesn’t have enough compensation for the lost pawn.) and now White is very much on top after both <span class="bold">2.Bg2 </span>(A “reset” that can be played if White suddenly freaks out a bit and decides that his Bishop is too far from home.) and <span class="bold">2.Qc4</span>, making new light-squared inroads.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White is doubled on the e-file (important since it’s the only open file on the board), he has more central and queenside space, and his Bishop is the master of the light-squares along the h1-a8 diagonal. Nevertheless, a lot of material has already been exchanged and the presence of Bishops of opposite colors leads one to believe that Black will be able to hold on. On top of all that, Black intends to swap Rooks along the e-file with …Rde8. Fortunately for White, there’s no need to worry since he has <span class="bold">1.Bc6!</span> (1…Qg4 2.Re4), permanently laying claim to the e-file. Now Black has no active plan and he can only sit back and passively wait, hoping that White won’t be able to figure out a way to break through. In the position after 1.Bc6, both sides are playing for two possible results: Black will either lose or draw, and White will either win or draw. Obviously, nobody would want to be in black’s shoes.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to Move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White enjoys extra space all over the board, but this battle is clearly about the minor pieces: Both have fallen on hard times—black’s Bishop is living in the dirt with no hope of improving its lot, while white’s Knight dreams of a better home than the hovel on c1. However, unlike the poor Bishop, the Knight doesn’t have to stay in the gutter. Two squares (the mansion on d5 and the mega-mansion on e6) beckon, and all White has to do is figure out how to get his horse there. Once you know your destination/goal, it’s easy to find the path to it: <span class="bold">1.Nd3</span> (1.Ne2 is also good) followed by 2.Nf4 and 3.Ne6. Once the Knight reaches its dream square, a well-timed g4-g5 advance will finish Black off.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-15" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-6"/>Lead in Development — You’re Outnumbered!</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A lead in development is a very dangerous thing, and the developmentally challenged side should do his best to keep things closed until his King gets safely castled and his other pieces find their way into the fray (thereby catching up in development and allowing a fight of equal armies).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Opening gambits are based on creating the imbalance of material vs. development, and they can give the attacker some quick wins if the opponent foolishly allows the position to open up.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.Bc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White has three pieces out to black’s one—on top of this, white’s other pieces can be developed far faster than black’s. It’s clear that the second player has to be careful! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Nf6?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The more prudent 6…e6 and 6…a6 are fine<span class="bold">.</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…dxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Foolishly doing exactly what White wanted him to do. Though 7…Nxe5?? 8.Nxe5 dxe5 9.Bxf7+ allows White to pick up the black Queen, 7…Ng4! refuses to let White completely rip the position open.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Qxd8+ Nxd8? </span></p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-16" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-5"/>Initiative — Calling the Shots</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I consider the initiative to be a physical manifestation of a psychological battle—both sides champion their view of things in the hope that the opponent will have to eventually forgo his own plans and react to yours. Thus, I usually refer to it as “Pushing Your Own Agenda” (presented in Part Four, Macho Chess), since that clarifies what the initiative is and, at the same time, it tells you how to get it!</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has just played 1.Nh4, intending 2.Ng6 (and, once g6 is covered, an eventual Nf5). Other than this obvious threat, White would like to swing his other Knight over to e3 and, from there, to d5. On the other hand, Black would like to take advantage of the somewhat loose Knight on c4 and the undefended pawn on a2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black can stop the Ng6 threat by 1…Kh7 but, by making a purely defensive move, White gets the opportunity to continue to push his agenda by 2.Bxc5 Qxc5 (2…Nxc5 3.Ne3 idea Nd5) 3.Ne3 Nb6 (3…Bxa2?? 4.Bh3 and Black is suddenly dead meat!) 4.Nd5! Bxd5 (4…Nxd5?? 5.exd5 Bxd5 6.Bxd5 Rxd5 7.Qe4+) 5.exd5 Ne7 6.Qe4+ Kh8 7.c4 and White has managed to create some interesting complications.</p>
			<p class="float-title">Philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">The initiative is a physical manifestation of a psychological battle.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Instead of handing White the initiative in this manner, Black should answer <span class="bold">1.Nh4</span> with <span class="bold">1…Qf7!</span> when Ng6 is stopped and c4 is under attack (it defends and pushes black’s agenda at the same time!). Now the e3-square isn’t available for White, but a Knight retreat hangs a2. Suddenly, Black is the one dictating the direction of the game and White has to scramble to keep his position together. His choices are all unappetizing:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>2.Rxd7 fails to 2…Rxd7 3.Bxc5 Bxc4 4.Qg4 Bxf1 5.Bxf1 (5.Bxf8 Bxg2) 5…Rfd8 and Black is two Exchanges up!</p>

			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>2.Rd5!? (an imaginative try to infuse some energy into his position and regain the initiative—White is hoping for 2…Bxd5 3.exd5 Ne7 4.Nxa5 Bxe3 5.fxe3 Nxd5 6.Nf5) 2…b6! ending the nonsense and leaving White in a quandary.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>2.b3 Bxc4 3.bxc4 Bxe3 4.fxe3 and White is left with an exceptionally ugly pawn formation.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This isn’t a book about attack, but I felt that King safety should be stressed since it’s a major factor (imbalance) in many games. In particular, this book will point to an uncastled King as something that should usually be avoided like the plague. In the diagrammed position, White has sacrificed a pawn but enjoys a lead in development and a safe King. Black’s King, though, is still in the center and White punishes it before it can get castled.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.Nxf7! Kxf7 </span>(Better is 1…Qc7 but there’s really no reason for Black to continue the game after 2.Nxh8) <span class="bold">2.Qxe6+ Kg6 3.Bd3+ Kh5 4.Qh3</span> mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The focus in this book won’t be on attacking techniques, but rather on recognizing the dangers of a central King—this will allow you to punish this transgression when it occurs in your games, and to avoid falling victim to this “illness” yourself. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-18" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-3"/>Statics vs. Dynamics — The Battle Between Short Term and Long Term Imbalances</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Statics and dynamics occur in every phase of the game. In general, a dynamic plus is something that needs to be used in a reasonably quick manner—either to score a knockout, or to create a long lasting static advantage of your own. A static imbalance gives its owner something that will be around for a long time—it can be part of an opening system (thus appearing in the first ten moves), cause both sides to march to a particular tune in the middlegame, and still be influencing play right into the endgame.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has an isolated d-pawn. Black views the pawn as a static weakness: quite a few of his pieces can gang up on it, and the fine d5-square is also a feather in black’s cap. White views the pawn as a dynamic strength: it gains central space, controls the two important squares on c5 and e5, and allows White (whose extra space makes his pieces more active than their black counterparts) to build up a nasty kingside attack in many lines. Countless world-class players have championed both sides of this position.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-19" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-2"/>Planning — Creating Your Own Future</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the third edition of <span class="italic">How To Reassess Your Chess</span>, I gave a thinking technique that I had personally found useful over the years. I felt it might prove equally useful for higher-level amateurs who had been struggling to create logical plans. However, the passage of time (which always brings new experience and insight) drastically changed my view about the practicality of <span class="italic">any</span> complex system of planning. My change of heart came about when I corresponded with students and lovers of chess from all over the world who were obsessed with finding plans (or were simply trying to grasp what a plan really was), and as a result hadn’t fully integrated the imbalances into their play. By breaking imbalances and plans into two separate things, I had inadvertently caused many hard working students of the game to lose sight of the one goal I had intended to push: <span class="bold">master the imbalances</span>.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though I no longer have faith in convoluted planning systems, I <span class="italic">have</span> retained the firm belief that fully understanding the imbalances is 100% attainable for players 1400 and up. Note the word “understanding.” This book trains you to recognize the imbalances in any board situation, to understand what each imbalance offers, and to know how to make use of it or diffuse it, depending on which side of the imbalance you are sitting on.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once you gain this knowledge and integrate it into your play, you’ll find that something surprising happens: the imbalances alone will often “tell” you what to do (or, at the very least, give you a firm push in the right direction)! Thus, if you possess a dynamic advantage you will know that your move needs to be dynamic in nature—a quiet positional move most likely won’t address the needs of the position. If your opponent has a glaringly weak pawn on an open file, you will know that at some point you will most likely want to go after it by placing your Rooks on that file. If you have a huge advantage in space, you will think twice before trading a bunch of pieces and alleviating some of his cramp.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">You can call this adherence to the dictates of the imbalances a plan, or simply a logical move or series of moves. The name isn’t important—mastering the imbalances <span class="italic">is </span>important and makes all this other stuff possible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Need proof? Go back and look at our first twelve examples. These are illustrations of the imbalances and how to use them, but in every case the imbalances presented simple but effective plans (a series of moves—be it two or four or eight or more—that logically makes use of your positive imbalances is indeed a plan).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s take a look at some games where imbalance-basics and impressive plans join together as one.</p>
			<p class="float-title">In a Nutshell</p>
			<p class="float-text">The imbalances alone will lead you to the right move(s) in most positions, or even help you create a detailed plan.</p>

			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>White has an advantage in queenside space.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black has a potentially weak pawn on c7.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If Black pushes the c7-pawn to c6 or c5, bxc6 will leave Black with a weak pawn on b6 and a hole on b5.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s d5-pawn is weak since it can’t be defended by another pawn.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s only source of counterplay is on the kingside—his d6-Bishop, e6-Rook, e4-Knight, and Queen are all eyeing that area.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s b7-Bishop, which is defending d5, is playing a purely defensive role.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s dark-squared Bishop is giving firm support to the c7-pawn while also playing a key role in any kingside attack that he might drum up.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>White’s b2-Bishop is inactive.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Armed with this imbalance breakdown, it might strike you that exchanging white’s worst piece for one of black’s best would be a great idea. And so, with no calculation, planning, or further rumination, White could confidently play the move Topalov himself chose. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Ba3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White forces the exchange of his worst piece for the critically important Bishop on d6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Rc8 16.Bxd6 cxd6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, 16…Rxd6 was possible, but then c7 would be a permanent source of concern. After 16…cxd6, that’s no longer the case. In addition, the e5-square is also covered (ending all Nf3-e5-c6 ideas). Of course, 16…cxd6 comes with its own baggage: the d5-pawn is weak and will need babysitting for the rest of the game.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Topalov (<span class="italic">New In Chess </span>4, 2007) now said: “As you can see, all this is not about concrete lines, but about clear positional weaknesses. I knew that it didn’t matter how long it would take me, but in the end all the Rooks would be exchanged, further highlighting his structural problems.” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Topalov, one of the greatest attacking players in the world, is making it clear that his course in this game isn’t dependent on his personal tastes (i.e., attack), but rather on the dictates of the board (a quiet buildup in accordance with the imbalances).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…Re7 19.Qb3 h6 20.Rxc8 Qxc8 21.Rc1 Rc7 22.Rxc7 Qxc7 23.Qc2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Topalov had this to say in regard to the position that would result after the exchange of Queens: “I can chase away the Knight on e4, transfer my Bishop to b3 and sooner or later I will exert pressure with two pieces on d5 and push my kingside pawns.” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Okay, there’s no getting around it—this is clearly a plan! But did he use any strange “system” to create it? No, this too is based on the imbalances: he will chase away black’s advanced Knight by f2-f3 (Knights need advanced squares to be effective—thus he intends to turn a good enemy piece into a passive one), he’ll aim his pieces against the weakness on d5, and then he’ll gain space on the kingside by advancing his pawns there (which would give him yet another positive imbalance to work with).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Qe7 24.Qc1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s Queen already controls the c-file, but now it also defends e3. This shows white’s intention to chase black’s one active piece away with an eventual f2-f3 (when the e3-pawn will be happy to have some support).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…g6 25.Nh2 Kg7 26.h4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This gains kingside space, deprives the e4-Knight of the g5-square, and threatens to win by f3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Ne8 27.f3 N4f6 28.Nf1 h5 29.Nf4 Nd7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">29…Nc7 followed by ...Ne6 was a better setup.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30.Qe1 Nf8 31.Qg3 Kh6 32.Nxh5!? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">32.Kf2 followed by Nf1-d2-b1-c3 would have continued the grind and maintained the pressure. However, Topalov decides to up the ante in his opponent’s time pressure. Can Black find all the right defensive moves with his clock rapidly ticking down to nothing?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game, which has nothing to do with our theme, is given with minimum comments: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">32…gxh5 </span>(32…Kxh5?? 33.Qf4 wins outright)<span class="bold"> 33.Qg8 f5 </span>(The only move) <span class="bold">34.Ng3 Ng7 35.Bxf5 Ng6 36.Bxg6 Kxg6 37.Nxh5! Qxe3+ 38.Kh2 Qe7?? </span>(Black cracks in time trouble and plays the losing move. Correct was <span class="bold">38…Qxd4</span> when a draw would be the most likely outcome)<span class="bold"> 39.Nf4+ Kf6 40.g4 Qf7 41.Qd8+ Qe7 42.Qg8 Qf7 43.Qd8+ Qe7 44.Qxe7+ </span>(44.Qxb6 was even stronger) <span class="bold">44...Kxe7 45.Kg3 Ne6 46.Nxe6 Kxe6 47.f4 Bc8 48.f5+ Kf7 49.h5 Bd7 50.h6 Kg8 51.Kf4 Be8 52.Kg5 Kf7 53.h7 Kg7 54.h8=Q+ Kxh8 55.Kf6 Bxb5 56. Ke7 Bd3 57.f6 Bg6 58.f7 Bxf7 59.Kxf7</span>, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">Here’s another example of a player finding a logical (and in this case deadly) sequence of moves by the simple act of trying to enhance an already existing imbalance.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="N.-Short---J.-Timman--Tilburg-1991"/>N. Short - J. Timman, Tilburg 1991<br class="calibre3"/>White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s clear that White is in complete control of this position—he owns thed-file (thus turning black’s Rooks into passive spectators) and his Queen is firmly ensconced on one of black’s weakened kingside dark squares. On the other hand, Black can hardly make a move, which means that White doesn’t have to fear any incoming fire. If you were to agonize over a plan without consulting the imbalances, you might become frustrated. However, if you merely asked, “I own the kingside dark squares. What other pieces can penetrate on them?” then you would be faced with a limited amount of options: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>1.Ng5 is the obvious candidate—it leaps to a dark square and threatens to chop on f7. Unfortunately, 1…Qxg2+ would put a damper on white’s celebrations.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>1.Rf4 takes up residence on f4 and intends to follow up with Rxf7, but 1…Qxd7 would be embarrassing.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>And this leaves only one other white piece that can drive down the dark-square highway—white’s King! But now we suddenly run into our beginner training/conditioning, which tells us to keep the King at home until an endgame is reached. And it’s this very fact that makes this game so charming!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Kf4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This move shocks many players, but if you had a Bishop on d2 would you hesitate to play Bh6, which forces mate? Of course not! Then, if it’s safe, why not use the King in the same way?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bc8 2.Kg5</span>, 1-0. The threat of Kh6 followed by mate on g7 ends the game. For example, 2…Kh7 3.Qxg6+ (or 3.Rxf7+ Rxf7 4.Qxf7+ Kh8 5.Kh6 when white’s King finishes up its journey with deadly effect) 3…Kh8 4.Qh6+ Kg8 5.Kf6 and mate follows white’s total domination of the kingside dark squares.</p>
			<p class="float-title">Philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Imbalances are the doorway to planning.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So was Short’s play a plan, or an illustration of the power of “Imbalance Consciousness?” Call it anything you like, but pay attention to the thing that allowed you to find the solution: the imbalances!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s take a moment off from our look at heady concepts and strange new philosophies and have a bit of fun. We’re going to look at a game through the eyes of three kinds of players. One (Mr. Metallic) shows us a person who dreams of thinking like a machine. The second is a guy (Mr. Pink) who knows nothing of imbalances, but seeks to live and die by the “Chess is about material and threats” mind-stream. Our third (Mr. Orange) is an imbalance aficionado. The first two will team up and take White, the third will handle the Black pieces. Note that the White players will be better at calculation, while Black will have a superior knowledge of opening theory.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="Mr.-Metallic-and-Mr.-Pink-vs.-Mr.-Orange--Fantasyland-2009"/>Mr. Metallic and Mr. Pink vs. Mr. Orange, Fantasyland 2009</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: Any reasonable move leaves us 0.12 to 0.18 ahead. I’ll go for that 0.18 figure!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: I want to play 1.e4. Does this hang anything? No. So far so good! Are we threatening anything after 1.e4? Not yet, but once we get our Bishop and Queen out, we’ll shred the sucker! Okay, 1.e4 is good!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: They gained central space, freed their light-squared Bishop and Queen, and took control over the d5-square. 1.e4 is obviously a good move, but my very strange looking opponents seem to be aggressive sorts so I’ll throw a bit of violence back at them and see how they react.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…d5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: Ah, an inferior reply. Now we’re 0.37 up! Victory is almost ours!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: Danger! Danger! Our e-pawn is hanging! Danger! We must take his pawn and, when he recaptures, we’ll bring a new attacking piece out and attack his Queen at the same time! Oh yeah, this is going to be good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.exd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: They played the best reply. I’ll develop a piece and take back on d5 with my Knight. I’ve looked this line over a bit and it’s interesting—especially if they don’t know what they are doing!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Nf6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: I think we can win material! By definition, I will eat everything that’s offered.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: He didn’t allow 2…Qxd5 3.Nc3 when we’re attacking his Queen. He would be dead meat then. Now I think we can win a pawn with 3.c4. True, in that case he can attack our Queen with 3…Bg4 but we could attack him right back with 4.f3. Am I good or what?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.c4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: The vacant look in their eyes tells me that they don’t have a clue. Of course, I can’t be sure of that. Perhaps they intend to answer my 3…c6 with 4.d4 when we will transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik Variation of the Caro-Kann. Since I’m mainly a Caro player, I don’t mind this at all.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…c6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: He’s giving us a pawn! We’ll have at least a 0.26 plus.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: We can chop on c6 when we’re a solid pawn up. What if we take by 4.dxc6 and he attacks us with 4…Bg4? We can still attack him back with 5.f3, but … I see something that’s really cool: 5.cxb7!! Bxd1 6.bxa8=Q and it’s over! I’m a genius!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.dxc6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: Wow! I didn’t think they would go for that. I’m now a pawn down but after I recapture with my Knight I’ll have a lead in development (which gives me a dynamic plus and chances for attack), control of the hole on d4 (a long-term static advantage), and pressure against white’s backward d-pawn (another long-term static plus).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…Nxc6</span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Mr. Metallic: A pity! The other recapture gave us at least a 0.72 advantage. Now he has some play, but a pawn is a pawn, so we should be happy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: So we’re already a pawn up. Does he have any threats? Just …Bg4, but we can answer it with Nf3 or Be2 or f3 or just about anything. All we need to do now is get our guys out, castle, and our extra pawn will win in the endgame—isn’t that what the grandmasters always do?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Nc3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: I own d4, but I would like to increase my control over that square again. I also need to develop my dark-squared Bishop and castle. 5…e5 seems to address all these issues. Of course, …e5 does weaken the d5-square, but he’s so far behind in development that there’s no way for him to take advantage of d5 for a long time to come. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…e5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: 0.09. We’re still in charge and we’re still a pawn ahead.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: He intends to answer 6.Nf3 with 6…e4, attacking our Knight. Fortunately, we should play 6.d3 when his pawn advance is stopped. Then we can follow with Nf3, Be2, 0-0, and we’re on our way to glory.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.d3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: Okay, I have all sorts of good positional options and I’m a bit confused. 6…Bb4 and 6…Bc5 both look promising, though I don’t really want to chop on c3 (after 6…Bb4) since after bxc3 he would suddenly cover the d4-hole. I’ll try 6…Bf5 since that targets his weakness on d3 while also preparing the well-timed dynamic thrust …e5-e4 if the situation calls for it. 6…Bf5 also gives me …Qd7 followed by …0-0-0 when I’m really piling up on d3!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Bf5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: 0.26 up and an extra pawn—it still looks nice for us.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: Can we make any threats? 7.Qf3 hits his Bishop but 7…Nd4 defends it, attacks our Queen, and threatens …Nc2+. No, we can’t do that! We’ll just continue our plan—develop, castle, and slide into a pawn up endgame victory. After 7.Nf3 we don’t have to worry about 7…e4 since he would be helping us reach that pawn up endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Nf3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: It’s hard to go wrong here. I can play 7…Qd7 followed by 8…0-0-0 and snip off d3, but that gives him time to castle. I really like the fact that his King is sitting in the middle, so I’ll play more aggressively. 7…Bb4 is very tempting since it makes …e5-e4 even stronger. But 7…e4 also looks good, and it forces him to take a path of my choosing. There’s just one problem: what happens after 7…e4 8.Nh4? How about 8…Bg4 9.f3 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 and if I can castle, his Swiss cheese position should allow me to wipe him out.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: White remains 0.17 ahead with 8.Nh4. Let’s do it! Besides, I think we’re doing well after 8.Nh4 Bg4 9.f3 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 11.Qe2+!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Pink: 8.Nh4 does attack his Bishop, but after 8…Bg4 he just attacks us back. Besides, aren’t Knights on the rim supposed to be grim? Or was that dim? Well, in any event I don’t like it at all. And your 8.Nh4 Bg4 9.f3 exf3 10.Nxf3 Bc5 11.Qe2+ runs into 11…Kd7! when his threat of …Re8 scares me to death. Let’s just take on e4 and go into a pawn up endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: But, I see lots of other variations after 11…Kd7. Let me show you!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: No. We’re playing 8.dxe4 and that’s that.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.dxe4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: I can take on e4 or take on d1. Both look good since any opening of the position has to favor my lead in development. I’ll take on e4 and see if he wants to capture on d8 and bring my Rook into play.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…Nxe4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic: Let’s play 9.Be3 Bb4 10.Qb3 Qf6 11.Rc1 Bh3 12.Qc2 Bf5 13.Bd3 Nxc3 14.bxc3 Qxc3+ 15.Qxc3 Bxd3 16.Nd4 0–0–0 17.Nxc6 Bxc3+ 18.Rxc3 bxc6 19.f3 (19.Bxa7 Rhe8+ 20.Be3 Re4 21.Kd2 Bxc4+ is 0.00) 19…Rd7 20.Kf2, 0.22 up for us!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Pink: Say what? I didn’t understand any of those moves. It all looks insane. Who would play a move like 11…Bh3, and even if the line you gave did occur, the opposite colored Bishops make it a dead draw. You’re starting to freak me out, Mr. Metallic! Instead of that garbage, let’s just play 9.Be2 and try to castle!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Be2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. Orange: He’s going to castle. I have to play with as much energy as possible or he’ll get his house in order. 9…Bb4, developing with threats, has to be right since 10.Qb3 runs into 10…Nc5.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What was the point of this example? These color-coded players are representations of three real human types:</p>
			<h5 class="para-title"><span class="bold">Mr. Metallic</span></h5>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In an age where every serious player has a powerful chess engine, I’ve watched a chess pandemic appear that’s unlike anything that’s ever been seen before: While following live grandmaster games, the masses of chess fans all suffer from a shared chess psychosis—they think they know exactly what’s going on. Topalov plays some extremely complex move and thousands write in eerie unison, “Topalov is 1.02 up! He’s going to win!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">They are parroting their engine’s assessment, but they seem to mistake it for their own. They stare at their machine’s rapid-fire burst of moves, but do they understand why it’s recommending them? One might think that a chess player would see beyond the illusion and not confuse his own strengths with those of his computer. Sadly, this is often not the case. And this same “illness” carries over to postal chess and analysis.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, once these computer-enhanced fans take part in an over-the-board tournament, their false reality quickly crashes and burns. But they can also be brought down to Earth by a few words from a good chess teacher. All he needs to ask (once an interesting position appears) is, “What’s going on here?” And suddenly an honest student will realize that he’s deceived himself! Since he hasn’t mastered the imbalances, he can’t answer the question in any deep and penetrating manner. And telling the teacher that so-and-so is 0.43 ahead borders on the insane. A chess engine can be very useful, but it can also turn into a crutch that actually prevents you from improving.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Metallic was created to show how nobody thinks like a computer, nor would we want to. Chess is a game rich in emotion, art, the rush of competition, and the joy of creation. Streams of variations and displayed numbers (0.21) turn a warm, extremely human game into something cold and unknowable.</p>
			<h5 class="para-title"><span class="bold">Mr. Pink</span></h5>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When you don’t have a grasp of the imbalances, you’re left with absolutely nothing, or (as in the case of Mr. Pink) with caveman basics like attack, defend, threats, and calculation. These are good things—everyone needs them. But is this simplistic ABC approach all you want for yourself?</p>
			<h5 class="para-title"><span class="bold">Mr. Orange</span></h5>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though Mr. Orange couldn’t calculate quite as deeply as his opponents, he saw far more than either of his foes. The imbalances gave him a well-rounded positional education that offered him a solid understanding of both quiet static positions and sharper dynamic ones.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Go back and look at all the comments. It’s clear that Mr. Orange was the only one that had any idea about the position’s secrets and ultimate worth. Now we turn to you, the reader of this book. You might not calculate very well, or you might calculate better than Mr. Orange (it’s always a good thing if you have the ability to calculate quickly and deeply, but knowledge of the imbalances will often get you by even if your absolute limit is a two-or-three move sequence), but wouldn’t you rather be in Mr. Orange’s shoes? If so, you’re on your way to acquiring the knowledge that most players (for reasons that elude me) simply don’t have.</p>

			<p class="float-text">A chess engine can be very useful, but it can also turn into a crutch that actually prevents you from improving.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-20" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-1"/>Talk to the Board and It Will Talk to You</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Everyone has some sort of internal dialogue when it’s their turn to move. Most players stare blankly at the board and think, “I go there and he goes there and I go there and he goes there!” It’s pure calculation, usually based on fear, aggression, or simply the desire to find something—<span class="italic">anything</span>—that seems reasonable. However, if I stopped you from calculating and asked, “Can you verbally break this position down for me?” the odds are that your answer wouldn’t be lecture-worthy. Make no mistake about this: at any given moment, you should be able to lecture other players about the pros and cons of any position you reach! And, if you can’t put your thumb on the pulse of the position, if you don’t know what both sides need to accomplish, then how are you going to find the right move? It’s like asking for driving directions to an unknown place.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is why most players feel lost at sea. They feel they don’t know what’s going on, and so try to patch up the cracks by looking for threats and/or looking for ways to create them. They know something’s wrong—something’s missing. But they don’t know what to do about it, and this creates a feeling of powerlessness. Trust me when I tell you that it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s time to get a bit crazy—once you master the imbalances (and if you read this book from beginning to end, you <span class="italic">will</span> master the imbalances!), it will be time to get up close and personal with the board. In general, you can figure out a good deal about any position by doing the following:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">First up is the <span class="italic">Armageddon Discourse</span>:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Make sure you are aware of any crude threats by the opponent, and also do a quick search for any basic tactical themes that might be present. This is usually done subconsciously by players 1800 and up. However, if you are lower rated, are prone to blunders, or feel that you have serious tactical issues, then it’s a good idea to take a few moments to get on top of this stuff.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Once you’ve made sure that Thor’s hammer isn’t going to descend on your head, it’s time for loftier considerations.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Ascertain the imbalances for both sides.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Then ask the board (in an internal dialogue), “What move or series of moves tries to take advantage of these factors?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Pretty simple!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let me stress once again that you should <span class="italic">not</span> be after plans per se (don’t allow yourself to get distracted by the “P” word), but rather moves that cater to the imbalances. As we’ve seen, when you do this, plans often seem to materialize by themselves.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s see how the imbalances can dictate the course that both players take in a game.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White dialogue: “He’s going to play …Bg7 and tie me down to the defense of the e5-pawn. My main plusses are the hole on f6 that his …g6 created, a lead in development, and his central King. So I have to get something going before he rectifies those problems with the simple …Bg7 and …0-0. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“12.Bg5, eyeing f6, doesn’t accomplish anything after 12…Bg7 since 13.Bf6? Bxf6 14.exf6 Ng8 wins my pawn. That leaves me with 12.Qd2 followed by 13.Bh6 (the trade of dark-squared Bishops might highlight the weakness of f6 and also leave his King a bit loose), or 12.c4, trying to rip open the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">“12.Qd2 Bg7 13.Bh6 Bxh6 14.Qxh6 Nf5 15.Qd2 Nh4 isn’t much, so I’ll give 12.c4 a go and try and generate some action before his King gets castled.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.c4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black dialogue: “This move, which tries to open up the position, makes a lot of sense. However, if he captures on d5 my Knight will find a great home there (and there is a Bishop vs. Knight battle, so I want my Knights to be as well-placed as possible). Since none of this worries me, I’ll continue with my intended …Bg7 and force his hand. Of course, he can chop on d5 and stop me from castling with Bc5, but what if I simply step back with …Bf8? My King would be quite happy on g7, and I can’t be worse with a Knight sitting on that magnificent d5-square.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12…Bg7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White dialogue: “He’s about to castle, so I have to follow through with 13.cxd5.”</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black dialogue: “I can’t be worse with a Knight like this!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Bc5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black dialogue: “Of course, my King’s in the center so I’m not going to do anything crazy like 14…Nxe5?? 15.Nxe5 Bxe5 16.Bb5+ and I would have to resign. However, I have no problem whatsoever with the exchange or dark-squared Bishops.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Bf8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White dialogue: “I’m not going to take on f8 since that would help him get his King to g7. Instead I’ll try 15.Qc1 intending to take on f8 followed by Qh6+.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Qc1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black dialogue: “An interesting move. He intends to chop on f8 and then, after …Kxf8, stop my planned …Kg7 with Qh6+. I’m also not high on 15…Bxc5 16.Qxc5 Rc8 17.Rac1. It’s not the end of the world, but he’s managed to stop me from getting my King to safety. Why give him anything? Seems to me that the problem with 15.Qc1 is that he’s sticking his Queen on a file that my Rook can occupy. Yes, after 15…Rc8 16.Bxf8 I have a little tactic.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Rc8 16.Bxf8 Nd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White dialogue: “Well, what can you do? When a guy plays well, he plays well. He didn’t let me achieve any of my goals.”</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White dialogue: “Okay, I have absolutely nothing. Time to tighten up and make a draw.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Indeed, the game ended in a draw in 43 moves. Note how all the ruminations were centered on the imbalances, and all the variations were also dedicated to the imbalances. This kind of logical breakdown of a position works for grandmasters and it will work for you too!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Our next example demonstrates how basic imbalance dialogue can even help solve double-edged, complicated positions.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The position is quite sharp. White could focus on thoughts of the potentially weak pawns on a6, c5, e4, f2, and h2, but he knows from experience that such a dynamic position calls for a dynamic solution (we will discuss Statics vs. Dynamics in Part Six). Several things must have caught white’s eye: the Knight is pinned, if the Bishop wasn’t on h6, Qh8+ would win, if Qf6 was possible, that would win the Knight, and if d5-d6 could be played, that would open the a2-g8 diagonal for white’s light-squared Bishop—a fact that might well increase the power of an attack against black’s King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If we look for a move that addresses all these factors, it would be 1.Bf4, but that loses to 1…Qxf4 2.Qh8+ Ke7 3.Qxg7 Qxf2+. So Bf4 would be ideal <span class="italic">if</span> it couldn’t be taken. Many players would just give up on it and play something like 1.Bg5, which also embraces some of the points we discussed—1…Kg8 allows White to unleash the passed d-pawn by 2.Be7, and 1…Qxh2 loses outright to 2.Qxh2 Bxh2 3.Rh1 when a retreat by black’s Bishop allows a landing on h8. Thus, after 1.Bg5 Black pretty much has to block the h-file with 1…Nh5 when 2.Qxe4 is obviously good for White, but one gets the impression that he should have been able to do much better.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In the game, White knew that Bf4 was ideal but not immediately possible, but instead of saying, “I can’t”, he went out of his way to find a move that would make Bf4 a reality.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rg4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Winning. 2.Bf4 is threatened and Black has no good way to deal with it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Qxh2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Discouraged, Black goes down right away. However, there wasn’t a defense: 1…Qb6 loses to both 2.d6 Qxd6 (2…Bxd6 3.Qf6) 3.Bf4 and 2.Rxe4 Kg8 3.d6 Qxd6 4.Bf4. Perhaps 1…Kg8 was best, but then 2.Bf4 Qd7 3.Bxc7 Qxc7 4.Rxg6 is pretty grim.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2.Qf6</span>, 1-0. Black had no desire to see 2…Be5 3.Bxg7+ or 2…Qxh6 3.d6. There will be much more on this kind of “I want to do it and I <span class="italic">will </span>find a way!” mentality in Part Four, Psychological Meanderings.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">You now know what an imbalance is. You know that imbalances can help you figure out what’s going on in most positions. And you know that achieving a firm understanding of each individual imbalance will catapult you past the players that you considered to be your equals. If you’re ready to dedicate yourself to the study of this book, if you’re ready to immerse yourself in new and illuminating concepts, then head for the next chapter and begin an exciting new journey of chess discovery.</p>
