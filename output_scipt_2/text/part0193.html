			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is spatially challenged on the queenside, but the most noticeable drawback to his game is the light-squared Bishop which, on b7, is a true Tall-Pawn. White’s Bishop on d2 can leap into activity via Bf4, but white’s other Bishop seems to be hitting granite on d5. Thus, white’s first order of business is to crack open the center and activate the slacker on g2. Remember: More often than not you have to make a Bishop active—you can’t count on it to happen by itself!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I know that Bf4 was tempting, but my main concern is that you noticed that your g2-Bishop isn’t as active as it could be. If that simple thought crossed your mind, then I’m happy. And if you also decided to do something about the g2-Bishop’s plight and decided on e2-e4, then prepare to be worshipped as a chess god.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.e4 dxe4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Worse is 21…d4 22.Ne2 when the d-pawn will fall.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22.Nxe4 Nxe4 23.Bxe4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now we can see that e2-e4 had another point too: it opened the d-file for white’s d1-Rook and made the hole on d6 accessible to white’s pieces.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 23.Bxe4 white’s advantage can’t be in doubt: aside from the disparity in the state of both sides’ light-squared Bishops, the weakness of the c6-pawn (which will be vulnerable for the rest of the game) means that White has a target and Black doesn’t.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Qe6 24.Bf3 Qf6 25.Bf4 Re7 26.Rd6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s position has noticeably deteriorated. How did this happen? It’s clear that White didn’t do anything brilliant. In fact, all he did was to activate his Bishop, take aim at a weak pawn, and make use of a hole on an open file. These are things anyone can do! Yet, white’s play is bringing a strong grandmaster like Malakhov to his knees!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Re6 27.Rxe6 Qxe6 28.Qd2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">More simple chess—White claims the d-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28…Qf5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Perhaps 28…Re8 was a tad better, though after 29.Rd1 Qc8 (29…Qh3 30.Qd6 leaves Black with nothing better than 30…Qc8. However, notice that 29…Qh3 30.Qd7?? would be unfortunate due to 30…Re1+) 30.Kg2 Black would be doomed to a long, passive, miserable defensive chore.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.Re1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Greed is good. White grabs both center files. Now every white piece is doing a better job than its black counterpart.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Bf8 30.Kg2 a5 31.a3 axb4 32.axb4 h5 33.h4 Qc8 34.Be5 Qd8 35.Qf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Total domination. The rest of the game illustrates just how horrible black’s light-squared Bishop really is.</p>
