			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White has an extra pawn. Is it a weakness that can be nipped at and eventually eaten? No, it’s a protected passed pawn! White also has two Bishops while all Black can brag about is a lead in development. Surely White must be much better? But, here comes another “no”—Black actually enjoys excellent compensation (note that I’m not stating that Black is better, just that he has real compensation)! The reasons for this are simple: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black has all the play while White will be forced to take a defensive stance for a long time to come.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The passed g-pawn isn’t going anywhere.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The light-squares around white’s King are vulnerable.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s play is easy to find—double on the h-file and go after “Fred” on g1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, most chess engines will leap on white’s bandwagon and proclaim black’s inferiority to all who will listen. However, don’t let yourself become a “Fritz slave”! Don’t deprive yourself of instruction just because your computer is clouding your mind with a numeric (soulless) assessment. In his notes to <a id="Leko---Kramnik--Linares-2004"/>Leko - Kramnik, Linares 2004 (<span class="italic">New In Chess</span>, issue 3, 2004), Kramnik wrote the following witty and penetrating words about the masses of players who were following his game live: “Black has quite good compensation for the pawn, I considered during the game. ‘White is +0.72’ thought the numerous online spectators.”</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Owning an extra protected passed pawn while also having two Bishops and having traded Queens (the usual knockout punch when it comes to kingside attacks) would make most players lean towards white’s position. When you add my rather cruel act of giving White the move (usually indicating that white’s in charge) to the equation, it would be a rare (and very strong) player who would give Black his due.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Nf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black also gets plenty of play after 19.c4 (19.Kg2!?) 19…Rg7! since 20.f3? (20.cxd5 cxd5 21.Nf1 Rh8)  20…Bxf3 21.Nxf3?? Rxg3+ wins for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Rh8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">19…Rg7!? might be more accurate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Ne3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The actual game ended abruptly: 20.Nh2?? Rxh2 21.Kxh2 Rh8+ 22.Kg1 Bf3, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20…Rag8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">20…Rh5!?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Nxg4 Nxg4 22.Bf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">22.c4 Ndf6 23.cxd5 cxd5 24.Bd1 Kd7 also leaves White with no better than equality.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">22…Kd8 23.Bd1 Ndf6</span> and the threat of ...Rh2 ensures Black ample play and full compensation.</p>
