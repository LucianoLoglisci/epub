			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In chess, it’s easy to get a bit overwhelmed by all the ABCs that are tossed at the poor student. In particular, memorization-based material is often extremely daunting but also shockingly unrewarding. The most prized lessons in chess are those that train the mind to see things in a completely new way while also planting the seeds for proper mental habits. Here we’ll look at <span class="italic">Target Consciousness</span>, one of the game’s most overlooked yet critically important concepts. I try very hard to instill a deep understanding and appreciation of Target Consciousness in all my students (it doesn’t matter if they are rated 1200 or 2200). This term helps ram home a form of mental training where the player, in an almost shark-like manner, learns to instantly recognize all potential targets and, once he finds one, to leap on it like a shark rushes to blood.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I created the term when I found students ignoring glaring targets. “Why not make use of that weak square?” I’d ask. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The answer didn’t please me. “Square? You’re kidding, right? Why bother with a square? It’s not like I can capture it and put in the box.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“Okay, why not go after that isolated pawn?” I kept trying!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“I suppose I could, but his King is over <span class="italic">there</span>!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I gave it one last go. “Yes, I know where his King is, but it’s guarded by his whole army while you don’t have more than a couple pieces in that area. His pawn, though, is hanging out to dry.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, it seemed hopeless. “Yes, I see that the pawn is weak, but his King is over <span class="italic">there</span>!” Sigh.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As a result of this kind of conversation (repeated with many, many students), I realized that it was my job to make them realize that you can only attack a King if there’s reason to do so (<span class="italic">wanting</span> to attack it isn’t a reason!). Thus, I showed an endless cascade of games where grandmasters would dominate a square and/or surround and eventually pick off a pawn and score an easy victory. Once a player is fully convinced that there’s a safer, more reliable way to win at chess than unsound King-hunts, the idea of Target Consciousness becomes a passion! And, with that huge shift in general chess consciousness, the player is on his way to becoming a serious threat to anyone.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, at times there won’t be any existing targets. In that case you might decide to develop your forces, play for a superior minor piece or more space, nuke the board with a positional sacrifice of some sort, unleash a crazed tactic, try to behead his King (yes, there are many occasions when you <span class="italic">should</span> go after the enemy King!), or do any number of useful things. But a player that’s a Target Consciousness junkie won’t only be looking for targets to attack, he’ll also be looking for ways to create them! Once he does that, he’ll immediately sink his teeth into his new creation and chew the night away.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We’ll address three types of targets in this section:</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">WEAK PAWNS</span>—Perhaps the most common target. If an enemy pawn can’t be defended by another pawn, then your Target Consciousness mindset should make you want to gang up on the thing.</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">WEAK SQUARES</span>—A complex of weak squares allows a Rook to smoothly slide down a file (see Part Three: Rooks) and a Bishop to do its long-range “dominate the diagonal” dance (see Part Two: Minor Pieces). A single weak square, situated on the 4th, 5th, or 6th ranks, allows a Knight (or another piece) to set up shop close to or deep inside the enemy’s camp. These things allow your pieces to become stronger than their enemy counterparts.</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent-last-line"><span class="underlined">THE KING</span>—If the enemy King is stuck in the center, it might be time to put on your executioner’s cap and go for it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ready to reprogram your brain so that it becomes a lean, mean, Target Consciousness machine? If so, turn the page and let’s get this difficult but extremely rewarding process underway!</p>
