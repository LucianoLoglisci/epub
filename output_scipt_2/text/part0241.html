			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This game is a classic example of the need to pay attention. In diagram 220, Black is a pawn down and his King isn’t very safe. On the other hand, white’s King is still sitting in the middle of the board and tactics are possible based on the h1-Rook being undefended and X-rayed by the enemy Queen on c6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Naturally, if White is allowed to castle (ending the tactical problems along the h1-a8 diagonal and also getting the King out of harm’s way) then his material advantage will give him serious winning chances. Thus, Black must strike right away!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Black has a couple of attractive moves, but the one he chose turns out to be a dead end. I think the correct move is easily missed, while the mistake would prove attractive to a lot of players.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…f5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A tempting move that aims to clear the h1-a8 diagonal and drop a tactical bomb on white’s position. However, it fails to have the desired effect. Far better (and most likely overlooked) was 1…Rb8! 2.Qa1 (2.Qxb8?? Qc1 mate would be a sudden end to things, while 2.Qd1?? Nc3 3.Qc1 Rb1 wins) 2…Ra8 3.Qb2! (Dodging a bullet: 3.Qb1?? loses to 3…Nc3 4.Qc1 Nxe4! 5. Qh6+ [Avoiding 5.Qxc6?? Ra1+ 6.Qc1 Rxc1 mate] 5…Kf7 6.Qh7+ Ke6 7.0–0 Nc3 and Black has an extra piece) 3…Ra2 (If Black was happy with a draw, then 3…Rb8 4.Qa1 Ra8 is a perpetual on the white Queen. Black could also try 3…Rb8 4.Qa1 Nc3!? 5.0-0 Nxe2+, and though Black now has the better pawn structure, after 6.Kg2 black’s own King is so open that he doesn’t have any winning chances) 4.Qb1 f5 (4…Nc3 5.Qc1 Nxe4 6.Qh6+ Kf7 7.Qh7+ Ke6 is a draw since black’s Rook no longer controls its first rank, which allows checks there: 8.Qg8+ Kd6 9.Qf8+, =) 5. 0–0 Rxe2 (5…fxe4?? 6.Qxa2) 6.Rc1 Qa8 7.Nd6 and black’s vulnerable King allows White to hold the balance. For example: 7…Ne3 8.Nb7 Ng4 9.Rc7+ Kf6 10.Qc1 Nxf2 11.Rc6+ Kg7 12.Rc7+, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since the refutation of 1…f5 isn’t very subtle, one has to wonder how Black missed the far superior 1…Rb8. Of course, I can’t give a definitive answer without asking Mr. Mortel himself, but the usual “excuse” is something we’ve all been guilty of: we see a promising move and make it. We fail to follow the old maxim, “When you see a good move, sit on your hands and look for a better one.” and, as a result, end up in a ditch—we just play on emotion and fall victim to both a quick move situation and a lack of attention.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Ng5 Ne3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">2…Rb8 is better, though it doesn’t have the same effect as it did a move ago because 3.Qa1 (3.Rh7+?? Kf6 wins for Black) now attacks the undefended e5-pawn: 3…Kf6 4.Nh7+ Ke6 5.0–0 Nc3 6.e4 (Ripping open the center. 6.Re1 is also good) and black’s open King leaves him under serious pressure.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3.Rh7+ Kf6 4.fxe3 Kxg5 5.Qb4! f4 6.exf4+ exf4 7.Qxf8 Qc1+ 8.Kf2 Qe3+ 9.Kf1 Qc1+ 10.Kg2 </span>and this move takes us to our next problem:</p>
