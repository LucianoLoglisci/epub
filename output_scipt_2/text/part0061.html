			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>How can a player get beyond his fear of parting with material? He has to train himself to view each imbalance as something important, and he has to view material as just another imbalance to be collected or rejected, depending on the nature of the individual position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you create “imbalance vision” and make the search for (and understanding of) imbalances an addiction, your playing strength will take a quantum leap forward.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Embrace your inner greed! Having a material advantage gives you a larger/more powerful army (which can translate to greater force being brought to a key sector of the board) and/or the long-term advantage of “endgame odds” (knowing that most endgames will win for the material up side grants him tremendous flexibility). So by all means, eat everything in your path, as long as you’re aware of what (if anything) your opponent is getting in return.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you read the board and decide that it’s telling you to sacrifice material for a host of positional pluses, don’t hesitate to do so! Learning to conquer your chess fears and prejudices is a huge part of improving your overall game.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Being material ahead usually makes a player feel warm and fuzzy, but it’s an imbalance and must be weighed against all the other imbalances. It might offer a decisive plus, or it might pale in comparison to different static or dynamic imbalances (compensation) in any given position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Notice how sacrificing material and seeking material gains have been placed together. Both treat material as an imbalance (not something to be feared, avoided, worshipped, or always embraced), and the assessment of either decision (i.e., to take or to sacrifice) has to be based on the other imbalances on the board.</p>
