			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s start out with a simple but powerful statement: If you want your Rook(s) to be effective, they need an open file. This seems obvious, but the trick is to <span class="italic">demand</span> your Rooks get an open file—yet many players merely hope that one will magically materialize and, when it doesn’t, wonder why things didn’t go their way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Without an open file, a Bishop or Knight might easily outperform the Rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns while it sadly dreams of unrealized potential. Yes, this is basic, but it’s also extremely important and is often neglected by beginners and even tournament players in the “E” (under 1200), “D” (1200 to 1399), “C” (1400 to 1599) and “B” (1600 to 1799) levels. In fact, the battle to energize your Rooks starts right in the opening.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">For example, a glance at this poor opening sequence by White will immediately send a message to a trained eye: <span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.e3 Nf6 3.Nc3</span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 107</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div class="diagram-os">
					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00109.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">The message is that White, most likely, isn’t even thinking about the future of his Rooks! In fact, when I teach someone that plays in this type of fashion, I ask him, “What about your Rooks?” Usually the answer I get is something like, “Well, I’m just trying to develop my pieces. I’ll deal with the Rooks later.” Of course, invariably I find that this kind of player experiences serious problems activating his Rooks, and “later” often never comes.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Returning to that rather innocuous opening sequence (e3 was early—why block your own dark-squared Bishop for no good reason?), we would find that instead of 3.Nc3 (which blocks the c-pawn and leaves the Knight on a square where it won’t find much of a life), far better is 3.c4 and only then Nc3. The difference is felt by white’s whole army—suddenly the Knight on c3, combined with the pawn on c4, isn’t alone in its battle against d5. And, once the Rook moves to c1, a later cxd5 will allow it to exert influence down the c-file. Clearly, pawn tension and pawn breaks are the tools that create open (or half-open) files, and their use goes from the very basic (just seen in diagram 107) to the moderately basic (diagram 108), to solid tournament level (diagram 109), to the downright advanced (diagram 112).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In this position (diagram 108) black’s Rooks don’t have many options as far as open files go. However, White’s Rooks see happy times ahead by f2-f4 (now or later) gaining kingside space and suddenly making the f1-Rook a participant in the upcoming battle, or by b2-b4 (now or later) fighting for a queenside initiative and striving to get the a1-Rook into the thick of things on that wing.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This move, which threatens to win by Nxe7+ and also to double black’s pawns by Nxf6+, forces Black to capture on d5. However, its real purpose is to create a half-open file for white’s Rooks!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">15…Nxd5 16.exd5 Bd7 17.Rfe1 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Now we can see the point of white’s 15.Nd5—the former e4-pawn has moved off the e-file and onto d5 where it gains space and frees up that file for its Rooks. This allows them to exert tremendous pressure against the e7-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Re8 18.c3 h5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A move based on fear. Black was worried about g2-g4 and makes a move to prevent that advance and also to make f5 accessible to black’s Bishop. However, the cure is worse than the disease since now black’s kingside is seriously weakened (as shown by the rest of the game).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Re3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White intends to double on the e-file and increase his pressure against e7. Chess is easy to play when you have an open road to a glaring weakness (e7). However, the trick isn’t in using these things (anyone can do that), it’s in <span class="italic">creating</span> them!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Bf5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Calmly following his plan. The alternative, 19...Bxd4 20.Rxd4 Bf5, allows White to make use of the same strong Bishop maneuver that’s seen in the game. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Bxg7 Kxg7 21.Rde1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Moves don’t get more obvious or natural than this! Doubling on the e-file will force two black pieces to play babysitter to the e7-pawn. Note how powerful white’s doubled Rooks are in comparison to their passive black counterparts on a8 and e8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…Qd7    </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black thinks he has everything under control, but white’s next move shows that he’s badly mistaken.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Suddenly black’s Bishop is about to be surrounded by g2-g4. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22...Qc7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Stopping g2-g4 by 22…h4 runs into 23.Qf2 when the h4-pawn becomes black’s latest “targeted for assassination” unit. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">22...a5 23.g4 hxg4 24.hxg4 Bb1 25.f5! gives White a strong attack. For example:  25…Bxa2 26.Rxe7! Rxe7 27.f6+ Kg8 28.Rxe7, or 25...gxf5 26.Qf4 f6 27.g5 Be4 28.gxf6+ exf6 (28…Kxf6 29.Rxe4) 29.Rg3+ and Black can resign.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns. In this case “weak” alludes to pawns that can’t be protected by other pawns.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White is obviously better. His huge Knight (compare it to black’s horrible Bishop) and pressure against b5 gives him all the chances. He could play the position slowly and torture his opponent, but instead he realized that black’s King doesn’t have many defenders, and that his own Queen and Knight were putting some heat in that direction. A real attack might easily appear if his Rooks were on an open file and could penetrate into the enemy position. Therefore, why not bust open the b-file?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">36.a4! </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Rook has burst into black’s position and now the combined might of white’s Queen, Rook, and Knight (which are all aiming at black’s King) promise him a winning attack. His first threat is 39.Ne7+, picking up black’s Queen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">38…Qa6 39.Qf6?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A real shame. White could have forced a win by 39.Ne7+ Kg7 40.Nxg6!!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As we’ve seen, a file is a very valuable commodity because it’s the road that your Rook (and/or Queen) travels on in order to penetrate into the enemy position. That’s why such files are fiercely fought over, with both sides trying hard to make it their own. The most common way of wresting a file from the opponent is to pressure the enemy Rook and give it a simple but painful choice: trade on the file and give it up, or move the Rook away from the file, which also gives it up.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A common situation occurs when both side’s Rooks are facing off on a file and, apparently, nobody will ever own it.

Then the Bishop can be moved and the prize (the file) taken.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">It seems that a calm state of balance has been created on the c-file—if either player trades Rooks, the other side will recapture and get total control of the file.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black is a piece down and is also facing “death by a-pawn”, but his control of his 7th rank (and the enemy King’s discomfort) is so complete that he’ll easily hold the draw.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The final point—Black saw (back on the 26th move) that he couldn’t play 33...Rf3?? because of 34.Rd2! Rxd2 35.Kxd2 Rxf2+ 36.Kc3 when the a-pawn is supreme. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">All this shouldn’t give the impression that a Rook on the 7th rank or 8th rank is always advantageous. The following examples should put this in perspective. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has a Rook on the 7th rank, but who cares? There aren’t any targets on that rank, and black’s King isn’t bothered in the least by white’s empty 7th rank acquisition. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though White has the move, he’s quite lost (white’s pawns on a4 and c4 are ripe and ready for the taking). Thus, control of the seventh and eight ranks is symbolic of what a Rook might accomplish there. If it’s not able to “do its stuff”, then don’t bother moving there in the first place.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White controls the only open file, so he has all the chances in this position. After all the hoopla about the 7th rank, we simply have to ask if White should make the leap into d7? If black’s Rook stood on e8 instead of f8, then 1.Rd7 would be very strong, but in our actual position the grab for “7th” is misguided since it can be easily challenged. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.Rd7 Rf7 2.Rd8+ Rf8 </span>and white’s not accomplishing anything at all. Since the 7th rank just isn’t to be had, White would be well advised to show patience and improve the position of his King with 1.Kf3.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White owns the open d-file, his Rook is proudly sitting on the 7th rank where it attacks b7, and his position seems to be devoid of any weaknesses. Shouldn’t White be significantly better here? The answer is rather surprising—White doesn’t have more than a small plus. In fact, Maroczy, a magnificent endgame player, wasn’t even able to dent black’s shell.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Far more interesting is 24.Re1 when one can spend many hours delving into the position’s hidden treasures. Though an analysis of such an endgame (which often features both sides fighting to get pigs on the seventh) is way outside this book’s scope, I recommend that endgame enthusiasts focus on lines such as: 24…b6!? (24…h5!?, 24…Rb8!?, 24…Bxc5!?) 25.cxb6 Bxa3 26.bxa3 Rxb6 27.Ree7 (27.g3! is much tougher, and leads to many intricate variations) and now one simple but fun possibility is 27…Rb1+ 28.Ke2 Rb2+ 29.Ke3 Rxa2 (29…Rf8 is simpler) 30.Rxf7 Re8+ when 31.Kf3 is met by 31…Rf8 and 31.Kd3 is met by 31…Rd8!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I recall a story about a famous grandmaster that wanted to learn the complete truth about a certain endgame position. He got some friends together and they all hunkered down in the grandmaster’s apartment for several days, never leaving or seeing the light of day, and living on a diet of pizza, earthworms, and dried paint chips. Their ordeal only ended when the position had been completely deconstructed, rebuilt, and mastered.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Doing a deep analysis (alone or with friends) of any complex position is not only highly enjoyable, but also extremely instructive (though I recommend stocking up on real food and avoiding the earthworms and paint chips). If you have a chess teacher, then all the better! You can turn over your analysis to the chess pro and see how close to reality you were, and then have him show you the things you did wrong and help you fix those weak points. Of course, most people can’t afford the time for a seven-day adult slumber chess party (imagine your wife pounding on the door screaming, “Harold! Harold! What about your job Harold? What <span class="italic">are</span> you doing in there?”). Don’t despair! Analyze the position of interest over a several week period, giving it an hour here and an hour there. You’ll find the time was well spent!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White has been trying to cause havoc on his 7th rank, while also doing his best to make inroads into the eighth so that his b-pawn can promote. On the other hand, Black has held fast, and has also begun his own bid to race the e4- and f3-pawns to his 8th rank and promote them. The goals are clear, though achieving them is going to be based on pure tactics.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This example is raw entertainment, with the rub that it helps solidify the understanding that getting one’s heavy pieces (and pawns, since if they get to the eighth they turn into heavy pieces) to those ranks is serious business!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…e3!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since black’s goal is to get his pawns to the 8th rank, why waste a critical tempo moving the Bishop? In fact, in positions of this nature, time (rushing towards your goal with as much speed as possible) is often more important than material.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s an example of the difference one single tempo makes: 29…Bh6??
