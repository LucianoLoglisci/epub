			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I would like to thank all my students, who, over the years, have given me permission to use their games as instructive templates. In particular, I must give Pam Ruggiero (aka girl-brain) a full salute for sending me dozens of her games, some of which showed a high level of chess understanding, and others which illustrated weaknesses that most amateur players also share (thereby making these examples invaluable).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A debt of gratitude is also owed to both <span class="italic">New In Chess</span>, which allowed me to use various quotes from their wonderful magazine, and www.chess.com, that let me reprint some of the articles I wrote for them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I must give some love to my “posse”—Dr. Manuel Monasterio and the inimitable Vance Aandahl, Grandmasters Yasser Seirawan and Joel Benjamin, and International Masters John Watson, John Donaldson, Dr. Anthony Saidy, and Jack Peters. All of them helped with alternative piece names, analysis, and/or the sharing of general ideas that ultimately enriched the book.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Finally, I want to give a hearty thank you to Edward Winter, who offered important feedback on all things Capablanca, and International Master Elliott Winslow, who was happily retired from all chess-related things, only to be dragged screaming back into the fold when I nagged him, again and again, to put his life on hold and proof this book. Realizing that he had to shut me up or go insane, he ultimately complied.</p>
