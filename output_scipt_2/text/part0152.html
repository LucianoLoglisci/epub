			<h3 id="_idParaDest-128" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-8"/>Creating an Opening Repertoire</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">By far, the most common question I’m asked is, “What openings are best for me and how do I create a proper opening repertoire?” Of course, I warn them about the “spending all your study time memorizing variations rather than learning how to play good chess” syndrome, but then I cave to their query and point out the following critical points which have to be addressed when choosing an opening system that’s right for a particular individual:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that suit your style/temperament—just because the world’s best players use it doesn’t mean that it’s right for you!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that suit both your schedule and memory—if you decide on a mainline Najdorf for Black (<span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6</span>), make sure you have the vast amount of time it takes to look at the endless stream of variations, and make sure you have the ability to memorize all that information. There are many openings that demand far less “theoretical housekeeping” and are far more forgiving of those whose memories have seen better days.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that cater to your chess strengths—i.e., if you play closed positions really well, go for systems that tend to lock up the center. If you are a strong positional player but can’t always “keep up” in sharp tactical situations, pick lines that avoid chaos. If tactics is what you’re all about, make sure your opening choices are conducive to that particular talent.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that make you happy—this might sound a tad strange, but if the positions you achieve from your openings don’t make you feel excited, happy, or at the very least, deeply satisfied, then why in the world are you using those systems?</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Don’t choose openings based on the opinion of others, on chess squiggles like += and =, or on computer assessments. Even if a position is thought to be mildly better for the other side, that doesn’t mean it’s not fully playable—often a player’s affinity for a particular position is far more important than its reputation. Basically, if you like it, then play it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now, let’s come to a FULL STOP!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The above information is for players who want their openings to highlight their existing strengths and, as a result, give them immediate positive results. However, if you are more interested in improving your overall understanding (rather than just gaining a few rating points due to the help of a complementary opening repertoire), then a very different opening philosophy can be implemented:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that <span class="italic">don’t</span> suit your style/temperament!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that cater to your chess <span class="italic">weaknesses</span>!</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that freak you out and leave you feeling vulnerable and insecure!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In other words, this system of thought recommends openings that force you to come face to face with your chess failings so you can patch them up! Thus, if you’re starting out and don’t feel comfortable attacking the opponent’s King, take up crazy gambits that lead to wide open positions and sharp tactics (1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 is one example). If you are an experienced player (perhaps 1400 - 1900) who has earned his successes by playing solid openings but who fears sharper positions, switch to 1.e4 and dive head first into more fluid situations. If you are a pretty good attacker but hide from positional chess, which you view as dull or alien, throw away your beloved 1.e4 and switch to 1.d4 or even 1.c4 and see how the other half lives. Grandmaster Nick de Firmian, an internationally feared attacking player, did this when he realized that his positional understanding wasn’t on the same (extremely high) level as his dynamic skills. He took up 1.d4 for a year and, once he gained the necessary lessons, went back to 1.e4 wiser and stronger than ever.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Be warned! This “bizarro” repertoire is only for brave souls who are extremely dedicated to improving every facet of their game, no matter how much pain and humiliation it takes for them to achieve it (and there <span class="italic">will</span> be pain and humiliation since you’ll suffer many losses as you slowly but surely raise the level of your chess IQ).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, all this (via either philosophical repertoire system) is just the start of creating a very personal, very effective opening repertoire. For example, learning all the basic plans and tactics that usually arise from your openings is also a must. However, even with the addition of the plans and tactics, both philosophical repertoire systems are still missing one final piece of the opening puzzle: Whether your opening is dynamic, static, closed, or open, you need to fully understand the interplay of imbalances that your opening offers.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-129" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-6"/>Integrating Imbalances With Your Opening Choices</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Integrating your understanding of imbalances (and, since you’ve gotten this far in the book, I expect you to have a very healthy grasp of this subject!) into your openings is a virtual must, since most of the time the lines you’ve memorized will be avoided by opponents who don’t know what’s going on, and/or don’t know what the right moves are. This isn’t a big deal for a player who understands the soul of his opening, since he’ll immediately realize if his opponent’s non-book move does or does not make sense, and what has to be done to punish it or, if the move is fine but new, how to handle the position in a logical manner. Players who only know a bunch of moves won’t be able to do this.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One example is the Accelerated Dragon, Maroczy Bind: <span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4</span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 383</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As Black, you need to know white’s intentions and your general plans, setups, the kinds of endgames that you do and don’t want, and the usual imbalances all these things will offer you. Since this isn’t an opening book, we’ll keep it very simple.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Maroczy Basics:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s 5.c4 gains central and queenside space, making black’s usual pawn-break ideas (…b7-b5 and …d7-d5) very difficult to achieve. White gets a firm grip on d5 and will usually place a Knight there—if Black plays …e7-e6, he deprives white’s army use of d5 but also leaves the d7-pawn and the d6-square potentially weak.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At times White can simply hunker down with b2-b3 and f2-f3 and hope that his space advantage will suffocate Black. White can also advance his queenside pawns, hoping to overrun that wing, or play f2-f4-f5 and build up a kingside attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s clear that passive play won’t hold up in the face of white’s space advantage. But what can Black do? There are several plans:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black can set up shop on the dark squares. There are a few ways to do this, but the most common is to swap the c6-Knight for white’s horse on d4, and eventually trade the dark squared Bishops. Then squares such as a5 and/or b4 become livable for black’s Queen, and c5 or d4 can be grabbed by black’s remaining Knight.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black can swap off as many minor pieces as possible and leave himself (ideally) with a powerful Knight (on c5 or d4) versus a bad light-square Bishop. This often leads to a favorable endgame for Black.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black can play for the …b7-b5 pawn break, fighting for queenside domination. </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black can play for the …d7-d5 pawn break, ripping open the center. I said that 5.c4 made these pawn breaks difficult for Black to achieve, but not impossible!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So we’ve determined that the main imbalances in the Maroczy are space (which brings about pawn breaks, designed to combat white’s spatial advantage), possible minor piece plusses, and square control. There’s a lot more, of course, but this little bit of knowledge will make an Accelerated Dragon fan’s life much easier.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s look at a couple of these ideas in action. First up, the …d5 break:</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="J.-Berry---J.-Silman--Phoenix-1975"/>J. Berry - J. Silman, Phoenix 1975</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Transposing back into a Maroczy Bind.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 b6 8.Nc2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Following the old adage that the side with more space should avoid unnecessary exchanges.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">8…Bb7 9.Be2 0–0 10.Qd2 d6 11.0–0 Qd7 12.f3 Rfd8 13.Rad1 Rac8 14.Bh6 e6 </span></p>

					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00387.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Instead of playing one of the safer systems versus white’s Maroczy, I decide that some risks are in order if I want to go all out for a win (thus my choice of 7…b6). With 14…e6 I show my desire to break with a well-timed …d6-d5 push.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Bg5 Ne7</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Still aiming for …d6-d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Qf4 Ne8 17.Qh4 f6 18.Bc1 Nc7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">They call this single-minded determination! For Black, it’s …d6-d5 or bust.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">19.Rd3 d5! </span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">At last! It almost seems like the whole world is concentrating on d5!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Rfd1 Qe8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has achieved his aim—he’s created a sharp game with chances for both sides. Will White be able to handle this change from the usual safe “Maroczy control” to the present knife fight?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Ne3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White gets nothing from 21.cxd5 exd5 22.Nd4 dxe4 23.fxe4 Ba6 24.Rh3 h5 with equal chances. Note that 25.g4? f5! is something White should avoid.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…f5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It turns out that I was the first to go wrong! I fell in love with the tension and wanted to increase it right away. However, it was far wiser to try 21…Qf7!? if I was determined to ride the tension train, or  21…dxe4! if I just wanted an easy game: 22.Nxe4 Rxd3 23.Bxd3 Bxe4 24.Bxe4 Rd8 with approximately equal chances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22.cxd5 exd5 23.exf5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The complex nature of the position (and the ticking of the clock!) is also making it hard for White to find the correct path. He should have played 23.exd5 Nexd5 24.Nexd5 Nxd5 25.Bg5! and black’s in trouble.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">23…gxf5 24.Nc2 Ng6 25.Qf2 Ne6 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White’s bind has been shattered and black’s extremely active army gives him the better chances. The rest of the game was marred by mistakes in mutual time pressure:<span class="bold"> 26.Bf1 d4! 27.Nxd4 Nxd4 28.Rxd4 Rxd4 29.Rxd4 Bxd4 30.Qxd4 Qe5 31.Qd7 Rc7 </span>(31…Qc5+! 32.Kh1 Qf2 33.Qe6+ Kg7 34.Qd7+ Kh8 gives Black a clear advantage) <span class="bold">32.Qd8+ Kg7 33.Bg5 Rf7 34.h4? h6 35.Bd2 Qc5+ 36.Kh2 Qe7? </span>(36…Bxf3! was the way to go.) <span class="bold">37.Qxe7 Rxe7 38.h5 Ne5? </span>(38…Rd7! maintained a large plus)<span class="bold"> 39.Nb5 Bxf3?? </span>(The usual blunder right before the time control. 39…Kf6 or 39…Kh7 was equal) <span class="bold">40.Bc3?? </span>(With no time to think and his flag hanging, he trusted me. 40.Bb4! would have turned the tables.) <span class="bold">40…Bxh5 </span>(Time pressure is over, and so is white’s position.)<span class="bold"> 41.Nd6 Kg6 42.Kg3 Nf7 43.Nc4 Be2</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The next Maroczy example shows three ideas that typically occur in this line—control over the dark squares (c5 and d4 in particular), the creation of a superior minor piece, and the …b7-b5 pawn break:</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="E.-Formanek---J.-Donaldson--Hartz-1987"/>E. Formanek - J. Donaldson, Hartz 1987</span></h6>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The start of a thematic black plan—he goes out of his way to exchange the dark-squared Bishops so that his other pieces can have free reign on the dark squares.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.a3 Bxd4+ 15.Qxd4 Nc5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The first sign of possible minor piece problems for White can be seen: black’s Knight is better than white’s, and his Bishop is also superior to the poor piece on e2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Bd1 e5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This takes control of the dark squares on d4 and f4, freezes the e4-pawn, and gains space. The potential weakness of the backward d-pawn will never be a factor.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Qe3 Ne6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Still working those dark squares! Black’s picturesque Knight is now reaching out to c5, d4, f4, and g5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Ne2?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Passively trying to keep black’s Knight out of d4. Note that moves such as 18.Nd5 or 18.Nb5 would both be met by Black snapping it off with his Bishop followed by …Nd4. The resulting minor piece battle (monster Knight versus poor Bishop) would clearly be in black’s favor. In this opening, Black is always looking for ways to create that particular minor piece advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…b5! </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 388</p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">In the previous game I achieved the …d5 break, and now we see Black making his dreams of a …b5 break come true.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Bc2 bxc4 20.bxc4 Qc7 21.Rb1 Rab8 22.h3 Rxb1 23.Rxb1 Rb8 24.Rxb8+ Qxb8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The endgame is very much in black’s favor (better Knight, better Bishop, and he’ll soon develop pressure against c4). The rest is a good illustration of Mr. Donaldson’s excellent technique: <span class="bold">25.Kf1 </span>(25.Qb3 Qa7+ 26.Kf1 Qc5)<span class="bold"> 25…Kg7 26.Ke1 Nc5 27.Kd2 Qb7 28.Kc1 Qb6 29.Kd2 Bd7 30.Qc3 f6 31.Bd3 Be6 32.Kc2 h5 33.h4 Nd7 34.Kd2 Qc5 35.g3 Nb6 36.Qb3 Nxc4+ 37.Bxc4 Bxc4 38.Qb7+ Bf7 39.Qe7 Qxa3 40.Nc3 Qb2+ 41.Kd3 Qb3 42.Kd2 Qb4 43.Kd3 Qd4+ 44.Kc2 Qf2+ 45.Kc1 Qe3+ 46.Kc2 Qxf3 47.Kd2 Qf2+ 48.Kd1 Qd4+ 49.Kc2 a4</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">IM Donaldson has all the Maroczy themes down to a science, but as we saw, just knowing a few setups and being aware of the imbalances generally enables a player to come up with clear, logical, effective plans. Let me repeat: these plans aren’t based on emotion or wish fulfillment—they are based on a clear appreciation of the imbalances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Speaking of wish fulfillment, let’s take a look at what can happen when a player decides to do something that suits his style, but doesn’t suit the position!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Long ago (in 1834), there were two players (De la Bourdonnais and McDonnell) who ruled the chess landscape with an iron grip. As is often the case, the public wanted to see these chess titans go at each other in a match, and that wish led to a protracted struggle of no less than 85 games, which were played over six matches in the same year! When the smoke cleared, De la Bourdonnais had won a decisive victory which proved that he was—without any doubt—the best player of his day. One reason for this match win was that De la Bourdonnais (described by an English observer of the time as, “a large, slovenly Frenchman who spent most of his time spitting and cursing, and at other times singing and laughing.”) played every phase of the game well, while McDonnell (an Irishman who was “quiet and reserved”) was pretty much a seek and destroy kind of guy. At the highest levels of any sport, a lack of balance is usually an insurmountable failing, and this match was just another example of that rule in action. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In several games, McDonnell (as Black) played a solid positional reply to 1.d4 (1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4) but then—deciding that he could make the opening choice suit his style rather than making moves that were conducive to the opening choice—he lashed out with the hyper-aggressive but ill-advised …f7-f5 (as early as move 3 and also later), hoping to heat things up. As a result, he was repeatedly slaughtered in various gory ways.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="De-la-Bourdonnais---A.-McDonnell--Match-1-Game-8--1834"/>De la Bourdonnais - A. McDonnell, Match 1 Game 8, 1834</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nc3 f5?</span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 389</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div class="diagram-os">
					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00392.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Just three moves into the opening and we already get the impression that something odd has occurred. While black’s first two moves create the time-honored Queen’s Gambit Accepted, his third (a suggestion of Philidor!) is something that rarely (probably never!) appears on a modern chessboard. This leaves us with an obvious question: Is 3...f5 bad, and if so, why? Surely a chess legend like Philidor and an attacking powerhouse like McDonnell saw a lot of good in 3...f5. Can you spot the positive features of black’s third move? </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The main point of 3…f5 is to fight for control over the important e4-square. Black envisions that, after a further ...Nf6, ...e6, and ...c6, he’ll have a firm grip on e4 and, as a result of having stopped White from expanding in the center with e2-e4, he’ll also have an unassailable hold on d5. These are noble positional dreams for a guy whose late-night ruminations were usually filled with enemy Kings running for their lives! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, dreams are one thing and reality is quite another—in this case black’s aggressive grab at e4 does more harm than good: …f5 (a dynamic try for static gold) weakens both e5 and e6, loosens up his King, blocks the c8-Bishop, and weakens the a2-g8 diagonal. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In a way, McDonnell’s love affair with …f5 demonstrates both his strength and his main weakness as a player: acting the role of bully and trying to make everyone believe your flawed vision works against inferior opposition, but when the opponent can see beyond the glitz and show how a move like …f5 is rotting away the very foundation of your position, it’s time to back off and try something less weakening. As we will see, McDonnell refused to accept the truth, and so his stubbornness led to him being pummeled time and again for the same mistake!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This reminds me of amateurs who fall in love with gambits like 1.e4 c5 2.b4 or 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5. They can be very effective against their inferiors and even their peers, so by all means play them if you enjoy this kind of game. But don’t embrace delusion and claim that they are good—they most certainly are not! Give it a go if you must, but once someone finally prepares for you in a proper manner and pushes you off the board, accept the writing on the wall and toss the whole mess into the garbage bin.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.e3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White, who is well aware of the shortcomings of black’s 3...f5 idea, realizes that crazy adventures are not called for since he’s not developed (don’t attack if your pieces aren’t ready for action). Thus, he intends to do the following: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Develop. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Win the c4-pawn before Black tries to defend it via ...c6 followed by ...b5. </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Dominate the weakened light-squares on the a2-g8 diagonal. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…e6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black closes the a2-g8 diagonal (knowing White will capture on c4), gives added support to the d5-square, and frees his f8-Bishop. So far, everything is going according to black’s plan.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Bxc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s hard to resist a move that develops, eats a pawn and takes control over a severely weakened diagonal!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…c6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Still plodding along with his plan of gaining control over the e4- and d5-squares. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Nf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White wants to get more pieces out before he goes into kill-mode. This move develops, eyes the hole on e5, allows for Ng5 in many variations (targeting e6), and also prepares to castle. Notice how white’s moves have been simple, safe, and natural, yet his opponent’s position has deteriorated after each one. This is due to the fact that black’s 3...f5 created long-term weaknesses that won’t be going away any time soon. In other words, if Black manages to hang on in the opening, White will make use of black’s structural weaknesses in the middlegame and torture him for a long time to come. And if White sees a chance to nuke his opponent, he’ll happily take it.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White, who enjoys a significant lead in development, shows a good sense of timing! Since his King can now castle at the drop of a hat, and since black’s King will remain in the center for the foreseeable future, de la Bourdonnais has every right to crack open the center because 0-0 followed by Re1 will quickly follow, while Qb3 is also lurking in the shadows.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Nevertheless, though the opening was going through a mutual refinement phase by both players in the next three games (the 10th, 12th, and 15th of Match One), the result was the same: White won them all. McDonnell’s handling of the system was getting better and better, but his 0-4 score in the QGA duel had to be hard to swallow. Thus, it wasn’t a surprise that emotion took over and he found himself revisiting his beloved …f7-f5, albeit in an improved fashion.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This series of games is the finest example I’ve ever come across of a gifted attacking player trying, over and over, to create a kingside attack in an opening that simply didn’t offer that option!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The message here should be crystal clear: if you <span class="italic">must</span> attack, play an opening that gives you a chance to make it a reality.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Unlike the games from the De la Bourdonnais - McDonnell match, this position <span class="italic">demands</span> that White attack on the kingside! Of course, that’s good news for Shirov, who is one of the finest attacking players on Earth. However, White would have to go for the kingside attack even if he was the ultra positional Ulf Andersson. At the risk of repeating myself for the thousandth time, you have to do what the position wants you to do!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, Shirov deliberately played this opening variation in the hope of reaching this kind of position—a position that suits his style very well.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Why does White have to attack here? He stands worse on the queenside and the center is more or less locked. That only leaves the kingside, so playing there is a no-brainer.

This blend of opening choice and style, and then opening to middlegame (and, if necessary, to endgame) follow-through (all in perfect balance with your chess strengths and tastes), is extremely important if you want to milk every drop from the openings you employ.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s a quick example of such a situation from the positional player’s point of view (we seem to have had a tad too many attacks in the preceding examples!). In this game White plays a line that’s designed to give him a tiny positional edge based on more space and a queenside pawn majority. White deliberately entered it in the opening (and Black also deliberately allowed it, expecting to draw), turned the slight plus into something more substantial in the Queenless middlegame, and then turned these “tiny” things into victory in the endgame.</p>

			<p class="float-text">An opening battle between two theoretically astute players ultimately boils down to a philosophical difference of opinion. But if you don’t know the philosophy (imbalances &amp; general ideas) behind your opening lines, then all you’re left with is random moves.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">And here grandmaster Radjabov gave us one sentence (from <span class="italic">New In Chess</span> 2, 2009) that is both simple and profound: “White has gained a lot of space on the queenside, but Black has a lot of play on the kingside.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">That’s it! This is what everyone needs to be able to do with any and every opening he plays—you need to know what your opening is giving to you, and what it’s giving to your opponent.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This kind of thing seems self-evident, but if, after the first 15 moves of your favorite opening, I was to pull you aside and ask you to explain exactly what this line is offering you and what it’s offering your opponent, would you be able to instantly lecture me on its basic building blocks? Can you do this with every opening you play? Most players can’t, and this is a tragedy since it’s so very simple to arm yourself with this oh-so-critical information.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In most cases, these philosophical opening arguments are never resolved if the openings are sound main line systems—both sides have their chances and the player who understands the position better, had a good-biorhythm day, or is simply stronger, usually does quite well. In the case of inferior or experimental openings, there might very well be a resolution with one side permanently being branded as inferior. Here’s an example of a well-intentioned positional try for Black achieving good results until a certain something appeared to destroy his fun.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Most players want an opening repertoire that suits their tastes/style and will hold up as the flow of fashion comes and goes. None of the mainstream openings (Caro-Kann, French Defense, 1.e4 e5, Sicilian, Gruenfeld Defense, King’s Indian, Queen’s Gambit, English Opening, etc.) will ever be refuted, so if you want to stick with something over a long period of time, go with the oldies but goodies and try and avoid strange gambits or a “too good to be true” flavor of the month. Staying with something allows you to create an intimate knowledge of all its secrets, and you’ll find that it will serve you well for a lifetime.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-130" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-5"/>Waylaid into Opening Chaos</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Usually you will find yourself in an opening of your choosing (something you’ve prepared beforehand—though whether that preparation is deep or shallow is up to your strength, experience, and/or work ethic), which means you should already know (to some extent) the main imbalances, ideas, and plans. On the other hand, your opponent might surprise you (for example, with 1.b4 or, as Black, something like 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d5) and drag you into something you’re clueless about.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the first case (i.e., you get an opening you’re familiar with), you should do fine since, even if your opponent leaves known theory at some point, you’ll be able to make moves that are sensible and good (fully in accordance with the imbalances) for the upcoming middlegame. Things get a bit more taxing if you end up in undiscovered country, though if it’s some positional line then you should get by fine by simply returning to your “imbalance roots.” For example, after 1.b4 you realize that White is gaining queenside space and also intends Bb2. Pretty simple! You can say, “Okay, he took queenside space so I’ll take something too—how about central space?” And so 1…e5 makes perfect sense. Then you would continue going for the center (and striving to make your center indestructible) while he would attack your center from the side and try to continue making queenside gains. You wouldn’t know any theory about 1.b4, but your approach would ensure a balanced fight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Harder to deal with is some tactical surprise in the opening. In this case, rational thought (imbalances) might have to take a back seat to raw calculation. However, just because your opponent tries to drag you down the rabbit hole doesn’t mean you have to go! The following shows just such a situation.</p>

The philosophy of stepping away from sharp opening surprises with a calming move that keeps the position sane and “imbalance friendly” has served me well on many occasions, and I recommend you make use of it to!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Nxc3 8.bxc3 c5 9.0–0 </span>with a slight pull for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though my “don’t needlessly leap into the rabbit hole” philosophy showed its worth over the course of my career, there were times when my opponent’s “transgression” was so great that I couldn’t back down. Here’s a case in point:</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="J.-Silman---D.-Root--Berkeley-1981"/>J. Silman - D. Root, Berkeley 1981</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Just two moves, and Black has managed to push his d- and e-pawns to their 4th rank. Here, answering 2…e5 with a quiet move (3.Nc3, 3.e3, etc.) just won’t cut it since black’s pawn center and easy development assures him a good game. Would you let Black, after just <span class="italic">two</span> moves, get away with this affront to all that’s sane and right? No! Black has demanded too much too fast, and a guy has to draw a line in the sand at some point!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.dxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I didn’t know much Albin Counter Gambit theory (I spent my study time on more mainstream openings), but the die had been cast and I accepted that my dream of a quiet positional struggle wasn’t going to come true. Now my mood swung to one of do or die—he would follow with the space-gaining …d4 and then try and build up an attacking position, and I would welcome the fight by mixing energetic development with raw, overwhelming greed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3…d4 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.g3 Bg4 6.Bg2 Qd7 7.0–0 h5 8.Qb3 Nge7 9.Bg5 h4 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black’s attacking like a madman, but isn’t he offering me a <span class="italic">second</span> pawn? I’m willing to put up with a lot of humiliation for two pawns!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Bxh4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I felt like I was at an all-you-can-eat buffet.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…Ng6 11.Bg5 Rh5 12.Nbd2 Bb4 13.Rfd1</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The theme of the game is obvious: he plays some hyper-aggressive move, and I either develop another piece or devour something.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…f6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Really—you want me to take something else?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.exf6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Okay, that’s <span class="italic">three</span> pawns. Now show me what you got!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">14…0–0–0 15.fxg7 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 407</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">I never realized that chess was such an easy game. Of course, we’re still living in the world of imbalances: he’s trying to get to my King (for him, it is dynamics or bust) and I’m swallowing down everything that’s offered (White is wallowing in the sweet static taste of a huge material advantage).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Rg8 16.Ne4 Qxg7 17.h4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A case of too many good choices. 17.Bf6 was probably best, while 17.Nf6 Rxg5 18.Nxg8 was also strong, though a tad complicated. But why risk anything? I decided to lock in the victory by battening down my kingside hatches.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Be7 18.Bxe7 Qxe7 19.Nxd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="italic">Four</span> pawns. Lust for material (which offers you something chewy and tangible) is often far more gratifying than attack (which can easily turn out to be pie-in-the-sky).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Bd7 20.Qa3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, Black can’t afford to trade Queens.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">20…Nxd4 21.Rxd4 c5 22.Rd5 </span>(22.Rxd7! was even crisper), 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Keeping things on the opening paths you are familiar with is a good practical rule of thumb. However, when your opponent butts heads and insists on starting an immediate (but theoretically dubious) knife fight, you often have to get down and dirty and leap into the fray, even if you’re not conversant with theory.</p>
