			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black will be able to generate serious queenside pressure by …a5-a4 followed by …Rf8-b8-b4 placing heavy heat against both c4 and b2. However, the “other” battle is between black’s Tall-Pawn and white’s Knight, which will feel quite proud of itself after Ne4. Though going right for the queenside by 26…a4 followed by 27…Rfb8 would compensate for the inferior minor piece, Black wisely asked, “Why can’t I win both battles?”</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I would be happy with any player under 2200 that noticed both the minor piece battle and black’s queenside chances. However, actually seeing and having the courage to play black’s best move is quite another matter. It’s very instructive, but also calls for a lot of vision, courage, and confidence.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…e4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly the Bishop isn’t a Tall-Pawn anymore! Turning the dormant Bishop into a serious force is well worth the sacrificed pawn. This kind of thing, and the psychological processes involved in actually playing such a move, will be explored in Part Four, Psychological Meanderings.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Nxe4 Bd4+ 28.Kh1 a4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has been very methodical: first he activates his Bishop, then he forces white’s King to step to the far right of the board (away from the real fight on the queenside!), and finally he begins his assault against white’s queenside pawns.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.h4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This turns out poorly. Better was 29.Rfc1 Rfb8 30.Nc3, though Black has no problems after 30…Rb4 31.b3 Bxc3 32.Rxc3 Re8 33.Ra1 Re2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…gxh4 30.Kh2 Rfb8 31.b3 axb3 32.axb3 Ra2 </span>and black’s active pieces gave him all the chances. The rest of the game is a picture perfect case of a Bishop schooling a Knight: <span class="bold">33.Rfd1 Kf7 34.Rd2 Ra3 35.Kh3 Raxb3 36.Rxb3 Rxb3 37.Kxh4 Kg6 38.Rc2 Rb1 39.Ng3 h5 40.f4 Bf6+ 41.Kh3 Rb3 42.Kh2 h4 43.Ne2 Kf5 44.Ra2 Rb4 45.Ra8 Rxc4 46.Re8 Rb4 47.Re6 Rb3 48.g4+ hxg3+ e.p. 49.Nxg3+ Kg4 50.Ne2 Rb2 51.Kg2 Be5 52.Kf2 Bxf4 53.Re7 Kf5 54.Rf7+ Ke5 55.Kf3 Bd2 56.Rxc7 Kxd5 57.Ng3 Rb3+ 58.Kg2 Bf4 59.Ne2 Be5 60.Kf2 Ke4 61.Rh7 Rf3+ 62.Ke1 d5 63.Kd2 d4 64.Rh4+ Kd5,</span> 0-1.</p>
