			<p class="caption3">You’re a piece down. How should White recapture? Analysis isn’t necessary!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.e4 Nc6 5.Be2 a6 6.0–0 Qc7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Bd6 10.Kh1 Be5 11.Qe3 0–0 12.f4 Bxc3</span> - Diagram 181</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The game itself is extremely advanced, but the real purpose of this example is to show how falling into “I have to recapture” mode can blind you to possibilities that deserve at least a bit of exploration.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The only moves that can even be remotely considered are 13.bxc3, 13.Qxc3, and 13.e5. Everything else just loses a piece for nothing. If you noticed all three, then you solved the problem (even if you thought that 13.e5 had to be garbage, the fact that you noticed its existence is important). However, many players will have missed 13.e5 as a result of being in “I have to recapture” mode.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s down a piece and it’s obvious that he “must” get it back. However, it turns out that there are three playable ways to do this:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13.Qxc3 allows 13…Nxe4, but White gets some compensation on the dark squares after 14.Qd4 f5 (14…Nf6!?) 15.Be3.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13.bxc3 is the move that occurred in the actual game: 13…d6? (13…e5 is better) 14.Ba3 Rd8 15.Rad1 Ne8 16.e5 dxe5 17.Qxe5 Rd7 18.Kg1 Qxe5 19.fxe5 Rb8 20.c5 f6 21.c4 Nc7 22.Bf3 fxe5 23.Bb2, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Both these moves fall within the confines of the “I have to recapture my piece right away!” mindset. But our third choice, which also regains the piece, is something that’s far harder to find.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.e5!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So much for “I have to recapture.” Of course, this is an extremely advanced example. Don’t let it depress you (no, I don’t expect you to play moves like 13.e5). Instead, use it as an illustration that shows how a blanket “I have to” can affect players of every level. If “I have to” even torments grandmasters, then you can rest assured that it’s a large part of everyone’s game—it’s a serious disease that few even realize exists!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Bxe5?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other possibilities: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Bxb2? 14.Bxb2 Ne8 and now 15.Ba3 is, of course, both obvious and strong, but 15.c5!? is an interesting choice since it leaves the black army in prison for a long time to come.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Bb4? 14.exf6 gxf6 15.Qg3+ Kh8 16.Qh4 Qd8 17.f5 Rg8 18.Rf3 Rg7 19.Rh3 Be7 20.Bh6 Rg8 (20…Qg8 holds out longer, but is also horrible) 21.Bf8! mates.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Nd5? 14.cxd5 Bb4 15.d6 and White’s advantage (space!) is obvious.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…d5!? is interesting.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Ne4!? might be best: 14.Qxe4 f5 15.Qd3 Bb4 and though White is better, Black is still alive and kicking.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.fxe5 Ne8 15.Bd2 f6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Also possible is 15…d6, but then White claims a hefty plus with 16.Bb4 a5 17.Ba3 dxe5 (there’s nothing better since 17…f6 would be met by 18.Qd3! when either capture on e5 leads to the loss of the h7-pawn—18…fxe5 19.Rxf8+ Kxf8 20.Qxh7 and18…dxe5 19.Bxf8 Kxf8 20.Qxh7) 18.Bd3! (clearing the e-file with tempo) when both 18…f5 and 18…h6 lose the Exchange <span class="italic">and</span> the e5-pawn to 19.Bxf8 Kxf8 20.Rae1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Bh5!!</span> and White comes out with at least a large advantage in every line: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>16…Qxe5 17.Qxe5 fxe5 18.Rxf8+ Kxf8 19.Bb4+ d6 20.Rf1+ Nf6 21.Bxd6+ Kg8 22.Bf3 when Black’s in a serious bind: 22…Nd7 (22…e4 23.Bxe4) 23.Kg1 and it’s hard for Black to find useful moves.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>16…f5 17.Bb4.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>16…g6 17.exf6 Nxf6 (17…gxh5? 18.Qg5+ Kh8 19.f7 is game over, while 17…d6 18.Qg5 Qf7 19.Be2 is also most unpleasant for Black) 18.Bc3!! (Punishing black’s dark-square weaknesses) 18…Nxh5 (18…Qd8 19.Bxg6 hxg6 20.Qg5 Kg7 21.Rxf6 and Black has to part with his Queen by 21...Qxf6 since 21...Rxf6 22.Rf1 is even worse.) 19.Qd4 e5 20.Qd5+ and Black can resign.</p>
