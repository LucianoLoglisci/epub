			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has two Bishops vs. black’s Bishop and Knight. However, at the moment black’s Bishop is far stronger than either white Bishop (its control of the a8-h1 diagonal is terrifying), and the Knight also has far more possibilities than the enemy Bishops (it can leap to e4, d5, or even to c5 via d7). Why are the white minor pieces so ineffective? The answer is simple: the c1-Bishop isn’t developed and can’t seem to find a diagonal to call its own!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think some players would be misled into favoring White by his pressure against a7 down the a-file, and his two Bishops. Hopefully this problem will make you a bit more sympathetic towards Knights.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The inability of the c1-Bishop to show its stuff leaves Black with a clear advantage. Now let’s make a “slight adjustment” in the position: put white’s e-pawn on e4, his f-pawn on f3, and his dark-squared Bishop on e3. </p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move<br class="calibre3"/>Now White is better</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Suddenly black’s advantage is gone and White is the one who possesses a significant plus. Everything has changed! The Knight can no longer rest on e4 or d5 and the b7-Bishop’s diagonal has now been completely shut down. Let’s not forget white’s problem dark-squared Bishop. It’s still a problem, but a problem for Black! Sitting proudly on e3, it radiates power along two diagonals (g1-a7 and c1-h6).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As you can see, simply owning two Bishops and expecting them to win the game for you shows a serious misconception! All the position’s details need to be considered before making any kind of assessment.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Returning back to position in the actual game (diagram 103), Black needs to make sure the c1-Bishop remains miserable and, of course, he needs to make sure White can’t ever reach the fantasy situation mentioned above.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Rfd8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So simple, and so strong. A Rook takes the open file and prevents Bd2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Re1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">If 18.b4 then 18…Qc2 is annoying: 19.Bb5 (19.Ba6 Bxa6 20.Qxa6 Rd1 21.Rxd1 Qxd1+ 22.Qf1 Qc2 and White is in bad shape after both 23.h3 h6 24.Kh2 Rc8 and 23.e4 Qxe4 24.Bd2 Nd5 25.Bc3 f6) 19…a6 20.Ba4 Qg6 21.f3 e4! (not allowing the “dream” e3-e4) 22.f4 Rd3 23.Qa2 Rc8 with a winning game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…a5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is a very important, and very effective, move! Now the b3-pawn is fixed in place (since 19.b4 loses immediately to 19…axb4), a7 is no longer under any pressure, and Qb4 is permanently off the table. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Sacrificing a pawn to free the c1-Bishop—not an ideal solution, but it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a useful move! On 19.f3 (hoping against hope that he’ll be allowed to follow up with e4 and Be3) 19…e4 (Telling White that dreams rarely come true) 20.f4 Qc2! 21.Qe7 (21.Bf1 Rd1! is immediately decisive, and 21.Qa4 Nd5 22.Bd1 Qc7 23.Qxe4 Nb4 24.Qc4 Rac8 and now both 25.Qe2 Qd6 and 25.Qxc7 Rxc7 are both quite grim for White) 21…Rd7 22.Qe5 Qxe2! 23.Rxe2 Rd1+ 24.Kf2 Ng4+ 25.Kg3 Nxe5 26.fxe5 Rc8 27.Rd2 Rg1 White, who is still in a straightjacket, will soon lose material or find himself in a mating net.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">19…Bxe4 20.Bg5 h6 21.Rac1 Qb7 22.Bxf6 gxf6 23.Bf1 Rd4</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White has managed to develop his pieces and even tear apart the enemy King’s pawn cover. Unfortunately, Black is a solid pawn ahead, his King is far safer than one might suppose, and his pieces are on good, central squares. White (who is quite desperate) tries to create kingside threats, but it doesn’t lead to anything at all. The finish: <span class="bold">24.b4 Rxb4 25.Rc4 Rxc4 26.Bxc4 Kg7 27.h4 Bg6 28.Qg3 h5 29.Rd1 Qc7 30.Be2 Kh7 31.Qf3 Rd8 32.Re1 Rd6 33.b3 Qc5</span>, 0-1.</p>
