			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A glance would convince many players that Black is in trouble. White has a lead in development, he has more space, he threatens to capture the pawn on c6, and he even has the superior pawn structure! In fact, other than his two rather inactive Bishops, it’s hard to see what Black has to crow about. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I featured this position in a lecture I gave that had about 200 spectators (the ratings ranged from beginner to 2200+). I asked the crowd who was better here. The vast majority felt that White had a considerable advantage, while none of the 200 thought that Black had more than equality. </p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A tough one! I wouldn’t be surprised to see some masters missing it. Somehow, it’s anti-intuitive to give up the coveted two Bishops and to hand White a protected passed pawn to boot! Nevertheless, as you grow to appreciate a Knight’s blockading powers, you will begin to actively strive to create such situations.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bxe5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Wonderful! Black happily gives away his two Bishops in order to hand White a protected passed pawn! This is either very deep, or very stupid. However, since I gave it an exclamation point, you should probably vote for the former.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that 1…Qe8, retaining the two Bishops while also defending c6, is a mistake since 2.Nac4 grants White the advantage for all the reasons mentioned earlier. After 2…Be7, one problem Black will face is his weakness down the e-file, which White can highlight by the simple 3.Re2 followed by Rae1 (3.Nf3 is also excellent).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.dxe5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Unfortunately, 2.fxe5 fails to 2...f4 3.Bf2 f3 when Black has a strong attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A very logical move that both denies White use of the d4-square and prepares to place the c8-Bishop on b7 where it will laser its way through white’s position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">An interesting alternative is 2…g5, trying to blast open the g-file or, if White takes on g5, hoping to push the f-pawn down white’s throat. This demented looking move is fully playable, but Black doesn’t need to be in any hurry. He can always come back to this advance of the g-pawn once he tightens up his position and gets his Bishop on its ideal diagonal.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">A picture perfect blockading Knight</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s time to take a long look at the position after 2…c5. What has Black accomplished? One key point is that the e-file is now closed. White’s pawns are also on dark squares—this pawn structure significantly curtails the usefulness of the e3-Bishop. Once black’s Bishop reaches b7, the superiority of this Bishop over its e3 counterpart won’t be open to question. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">All of this should certainly make us feel good about black’s prospects, but aren’t we forgetting about white’s protected passed e-pawn? Not at all! That pawn is closing down the e-file and is firmly blockaded by the e6-Knight. This fine, flexible, square (it allows the Knight to exert influence over c5, d4, f4, and g5) wouldn’t be safe if the e-file was open, so some might label the e5-pawn as a traitor!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Simply put, after 2…c5 white’s pieces have no penetration points or targets to attack. White also lacks a pawn break. On the other hand, black’s pieces will prove to be far more active than white’s, and the …g7-g5 pawn break will hang over the other side like the Sword of Damocles.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Rad1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Rooks belong on open files, don’t they? White is happy to follow general rules, but he’ll soon discover that the d-file is a road to nowhere.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Qe8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Quietly moving his Queen to safety while also giving his Knight some support. Other Queen moves like 3…Qe7 and even 3…Qh4 are also good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">4.Nc4 </span>and now Black has to choose between 4…Bb7 (it would be hard to resist placing this Bishop on the tasty a8-h1 diagonal) with …g7-g5 to follow, and the immediate 4…g5 5.fxg5 f4 with an immediate attack. This attack (now or in another move or two) is completely justified because black’s Bishop, f-pawn, kingside Rook, Knight, and Queen would all take part in the festivities. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Those who are dying to get more information on passed pawns and blockading will find it in Part Eight.</p>
