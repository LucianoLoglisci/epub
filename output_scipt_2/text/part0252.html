			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 d6 6.Bd3 0–0 7.e4 e5 8.Ne2 Re8 9.f3 b6 10.0–0 Nc6 11.Be3 Ba6 12.Ng3 Na5 13.Qe2</span> - Diagram 286</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has managed to create the thematic two-minor-piece setup against the c4-pawn. However, there is no effective way to bring a third attacker to bear on it. The problem is that White has a monstrous pawn center and his pieces are poised for a kingside attack. Since the center and the kingside are white’s, Black must break though on the other side of the board or, ultimately, perish.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Other than the ideal …Qd8-d7-a4, which maximizes the pressure against c4 (though this maneuver can be stopped cold by a2-a4), the general way to get play in these positions is to attack c4 with the Queen from c6 or e6 and induce d4-d5, which gives Black use of the c5-square and also allows for …c7-c6, which will open the c-file for black’s Rooks. Unfortunately, the only way to do this is by …Qd8-d7-c6 or …Qd8-d7-e6. However, while Black is spending precious time trying to create a subtle shift in the pawn structure, white’s kingside attack will wash the black position away.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: It takes a pretty sophisticated player to fully appreciate when a known setup is and isn’t effective, and when one side’s well known plans are overshadowed by the opponent’s. On the other hand, most players like to attack and I would guess that white’s attacking prospects would prove both obvious and appealing to players 1900 and above.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Some samples:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Qd7 (intending 14…Qa4 or 14…Qc6 or 14…Qe6) 14.Bg5! (Extremely annoying! The Knight has nowhere to run to, the Queen can’t comfortably babysit it, and allowing White to double black’s kingside pawns is rather horrifying.) 14…Kh8 (14…Qe7 15.Nh5 wouldn’t make Black happy, while 14…Qe6 succeeds in getting White to advance the d-pawn, but it leads to kingside ruin after 15.d5 Qd7 16.Bxf6 gxf6 17.f4 with a murderous attack) 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.f4 Rg8 17.fxe5 fxe5 and now 18.Qf3 (18.Rf5!? is also tempting)  18…Qe6 (and not 18…Bxc4? 19.Qf6+ Rg7 20.Nf5) 19.Qxf7 Qxf7 20.Rxf7 Rac8 21.Raf1 Bxc4 22.Bxc4 Nxc4 23.R1f6 is clearly better for White.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13...Qe7 14.Bg5 h6 15.Bh4 Bc8 16.f4! exf4 (16…Bg4 17.Qf2) 17.Rxf4 g5 18.Qf3! Nh7 19.e5 gives White a raging attack.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Kh8 14.f4 exd4 (14…exf4 15.Bxf4 Qd7 16.e5 Qc6 17.Bg5 [17.Nh5 is also strong] is winning: 17…dxe5 [other moves fare no better, for example 17…Ng8 18.Qh5 h6 19.Rxf7 and 17…Nd7 18.Rxf7 Bxc4 19.Bxc4 Nxc4 20.Nf5 are both hopeless] 18.Rxf6 [the more pedestrian 18.Bxf6 Bxc4 19.Qg4 also gets the job done] 18…gxf6 19.Be4) 15.cxd4 c5 16.d5 favors White: 16…Qd7 17.Bd2 Qg4 18.Rf3 and Black’s in bad shape.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…h6 (The idea is to prevent Bg5, but this also wastes time and creates the possibility of various sacrificial explosions on h6) 14.Rad1 and now:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>14…Nc6 15.a3 (This stops lines like 15.f4 exd4 16.cxd4 Nb4. Since White has a solid center, he doesn’t have to be in any hurry.) 15…Qd7 16.h3 (Still taking his time before starting his attack. Now a later f4 can’t be met by ...Ng4.) 16… Na5 17.Nf5 (This targets the h6 move. Now explosions on h6 can occur at any moment.) 17…Kh8 (17…Qa4 18.Bxh6 gxh6 [18…g6 though still good for White, was a better defense] 19.Qe3 Bc8 20.Qxh6 Bxf5 21.exf5 and wins) 18.f4 exd4 19.Bxd4 Qe6 20.e5 Nc6 (20…Bxc4 21.Nxg7 wins) 21.Qf2 with advantage for White. For example: 21…dxe5 22.fxe5 Ng8 23.Qg3 g6 24.Nxh6 Nxh6 25.Qg5 Ng8 (25…Kg7 26.Rf6 is painful) 26.Rxf7 and it’s the end black’s world.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l2-lastline"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>14…Qd7 15.f4 exd4 (15…Ng4 16.Bc1 exd4 17.cxd4 Nf6 18.e5 is obviously silly for Black, while 15…Qa4 16.fxe5 dxe5 17.Rxf6 gives a winning attack) 16.Bxd4 (This avoids center destroying tricks like 16.cxd4 d5 17.cxd5 Bxd3 18.Qxd3 Nxe4 19.Nxe4 Qe7) 16…Qe6 17.Bxf6 (Also in white’s favor is 17.e5!? c5 18.exf6 cxd4 19.Qxe6 Rxe6 20.cxd4 Bxc4 21.fxg7 Re3 22.Bxc4 Nxc4 23.Rc1 d5 24.Nh5 Rd8 25.f5 b5 26.f6) 17…Qxf6 18.e5 Qe6 19.Qe4 g6 20.f5 Qxe5 21.fxg6 Qc5+ 22.Qd4 (A more imaginative solution is 22.Kh1 Rxe4 23.Nxe4 Qe5 24.Rxf7 Rf8 [or  24…Nxc4 25.Nf6+ Qxf6 26.Rxf6 Nb2 27.Be4 Nxd1 28.Bxa8]  25.Rdf1 Rxf7 26.gxf7+ Kf8 27.Nf6 and wins) 22…fxg6 23.Rf6 Qxd4+ 24.cxd4 Bxc4 25.Rxg6+ Kh7 (25…Kf7 26.Rf1+ Ke7 27.Rg7+ Ke6 28.Re1+ Kd5 29.Be4+ Rxe4 30.Rxe4) 26.Bc2 and White is better.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, Rubinstein didn’t need to analyze any of this. He knew from experience that this kind of structure, sans proper counterplay by Black, is in white’s favor.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game, Black played 13…c5. However, now 14.d5 doesn’t have any of the flaws that would exist if the black pawn still stood on c7 (opening the c-file with …c6 isn’t possible, and the c5-square is blocked and unusable). Since …Qd7 (intending …Qa4) can be stopped by a2-a4, Black has absolutely no counterplay and has to wait around as White calmly improves his position. Here’s the rest of the game: <span class="bold">13…c5 14.d5 Kh8 15.f4 Nd7 16.f5 f6 17.Nh5 Re7 18.g4 Qe8 19.g5? </span>(There is rarely a need to rush such positions, and there’s absolutely no doubt that a prime Rubinstein wouldn’t have done so. More in keeping with the position would have been 19.Kh1 Qf7 20.Rf2 Rg8 21.Rg1, etc.)<span class="bold"> 19…Bxc4! 20.Bxc4 Nxc4 21.gxf6 gxf6? </span>(Missing 21…Nxe3!)<span class="bold"> 22.Bh6 Nb2 23.Kh1 Nd3 24.Ng7 Rxg7 25.Bxg7+ Kxg7 26.Rg1+ Kh8 27.Qxd3 Qf7 28.Rg3 Rg8 29.Rag1 Rxg3 30.Rxg3 Nb8 31.Qe2 a6 32.a4 Qe8 33.h4 Qf7 34.Kg2 Qf8 35.h5 h6 36.Qg4 b5 37.axb5 axb5 38.Qg6 Nd7 39.Kf3 Nb6 40.Rg1 Na4 41.c4</span>, 1-0.</p>
