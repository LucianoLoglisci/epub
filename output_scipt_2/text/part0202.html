			<p class="caption4">White played <span class="bold">18.Bd3</span> and a draw was agreed. Was it really equal? Doesn’t White enjoy the Bishop pair in an open position?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Yes, White might well have an edge if he could retain his Bishops, but there was no way to stop Black from using our basic anti-two Bishops plan of trading off one of the Bs. In this case, Black would achieve it by …Nfd5 followed by …Bf4. Note that preventing this plan with 18.c4 failed tactically to 18…Bxg3 when White has to give up a pawn (19.Rxd8 Bxf2+) since 19.fxg3?? Rxd1 wins a whole piece.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The idea of trading off one of the enemy Bishops if the opponent has two of them is something a 1400 player can understand and use.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After <span class="bold">18.Bd3 </span>play might have continued <span class="bold">18…Nfd5 19.Ne4</span> (19.c4 Nb4 is annoying since it’s impossible for the d3-Bishop to defend itself while also keeping an eye on both c4 and a2) <span class="bold">19…Bf4</span> and White has absolutely nothing.</p>
