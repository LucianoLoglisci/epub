			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White (who was playing 10 simultaneous blindfold games!) has two Bishops (they aren’t very active at the moment) and the superior pawn structure—d6 in particular is begging to be attacked. Black would love to defend d6 and get his Knight to c5, where it hits e4 and b3 (tying down various white pieces in the process). Of course, White also has to address the threat to his Queen. Where should it go?</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Who doesn’t like Alekhine’s Gun? I have absolutely no doubt that players of all levels who are familiar with this setup will rush to make it happen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Qd1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This makes good sense and, if you found this move, then I can assume that Alekhine’s Gun (looked at in Part Three, Rooks) made an impression on you. The idea is simple: to lead with the Rooks as White triples against d6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Qc7 24.Rd2 Red8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Embracing pure passivity, which isn’t very wise. Far better is 23…Re6 intending to swing the Knight to its ideal home on c5 followed by …Rbe8, creating maximum heat against e4. White can’t allow that to happen, so an interesting battle would ensue where both sides would be fighting hard to get their way: 24.f4! Rbe8 (24…Nd7 25.e5! is a whole other kettle of fish: 25…Nf8 26.Rxd6 [26.Bd5!? Ree8 27.Rf3 dxe5 28.f5 is also interesting] 26…Rxd6 27.exd6 Qb6 28.Bf2 Bd4 29.Qd2 [29.Re2 Bxf2+ 30.Rxf2 Rd8 31.Bd5 Rxd6 32.Kg2 Nd7 and black’s Knight finds the c5-square after all, though 33.Qf3 Nc5 34.Re2 still leaves White with an edge] 29…Qxd6 [29…Bxe3 30.Bxe3 is just good for White] 30.Bd5 Qf6 31.Re4 Bxf2+ 32.Qxf2 Nd7 and Black will be okay once his Knight makes one last jump to c5) 25.Bf2 Nxe4 (25…Bf8 is better when White doesn’t have more than a slight pull) 26.Bxe4 Rxe4 27.Rxe4 Rxe4 14.Rxd6 and black’s position isn’t easy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">These lines are very instructive since they demonstrate a proper battle of ideas and imbalances where each side strives to maximize whatever their position offers. Compare that with the move played in the game (24…Red8)—this simply throws up his hands in exasperation and goes into panic mode.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Red3 </span>and White is in control of the position (and in control of his opponent’s state of mind). The rest featured more passive play by Black, which led to just the result one would expect:<span class="bold"> 25…Ne8 26.Rd5 b6 27.R2d3 Bf8 28.e5 Be7 29.exd6 Bxd6 30.Bd2 Kh7 31.Bf4</span>, 1-0.</p>
