			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you want your Rook(s) to be effective, they need an open file.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Without an open file, a Bishop or Knight might easily outperform the Rook, leaving it sitting passively behind its pawns while it sadly dreams of unrealized potential.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A half-open file is often used to exert tremendous pressure against weak enemy pawns. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A file is a very valuable commodity because it’s the road that your Rook travels on in order to penetrate into the enemy position. That’s why such files are often fought over, with both sides trying hard to make it their own.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The importance of open/half-open files (creating them, fighting to dominate them, penetrating into the enemy position on them, and using them to pressure weak enemy pawns) should be clear by now, but equally important is the enormous power of a Rook on the seventh or 8th rank.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>8th rank incursions are usually of a tactical or attacking nature, and back rank mates are part of every beginner’s tactical training.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Rook on the 8th rank can lead to all sorts of fun. However, control of the 7th rank is particularly prized because it not only annoys the enemy King, but also targets all the enemy pawns that have yet to venture forward.</p>
