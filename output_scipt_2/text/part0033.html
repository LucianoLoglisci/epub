			<h3 class="chapter-descripton">Grudge Match </h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ladies and gentlemen, in this corner we have a Knight—it leaps, it prances, nothing is safe from it, and you never know what the thing will do next! In the other corner we have a Bishop—it enjoys super speed and can go from one edge of the board to the other in a single bound! Are you ready for the brutal battles that occur when one faces the other? Are you ready for the carnage they leave in their wake, and the wailing cries of defeat the losing side makes when his Bishop or Knight fails in this all-minor piece faceoff? Okay, then in that case, let’s get ready to rumble!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">By now you’ve learned the ins and outs of both minor pieces. In fact, many of you probably have already picked a favorite. Tigran Petrosian placed Knights on a pedestal, your author also has a deep love of Knights, and most amateurs fear Knights far more than Bishops (Knights are, quite simply, trickier). On the other hand, Fischer was perhaps the greatest aficionado of Bishops ever seen, and the vast majority of grandmasters prefer Bishops to Knights. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Nevertheless, whatever one’s bias might be, you have to know how to get the most out of both pieces, and how to pit one against another. Fischer clearly preferred Bishops to Knights, but that didn’t stop him from winning a Knight vs. Bishop battle if he felt the position favored the horse. The same can be said for Knight worshippers. If these folk find themselves in a wide-open position, chances are the Bishop will be the minor piece of preference. Ultimately, the real value of the minor pieces depends on the combined imbalances on the board. The position is closed? Knights are often for choice. Are you staring at an endgame with mutual running passed pawns? The Bishop usually wipes the floor with the Knight. And which minor piece would you choose in a position where it’s all-important to be able to access both color squares—a Bishop can’t do that, so a Knight is the way to go.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This battle of the minor pieces—each possessing different powers—is my favorite in all of chess. If I possess a Knight, I try hard to imprint “Knight characteristics” on the board so that the rapidly approaching battle with the enemy Bishop will favor me. If I have a Bishop, I do everything possible to make the position “Bishop friendly.” The ability to create a promising position for your minor piece(s) will set you apart from the other players. In fact, after losing to your superior Knight (or Bishop), your depressed (and clueless!) opponent will often tell you that it was just bad luck that things didn’t work out for him!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The following things are critical in all Bishop vs. Knight battles:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Be aware that there is, or there is going to be, a Bishop vs. Knight battle! </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Be aware of <span class="italic">all</span> the imbalances and how they relate to the minor piece(s) you and your opponent own.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Create a board-situation that your minor piece craves! </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Please treat the variations in this example as a sort of theatrical drama—it might not be based on reality, but it has a profound effect on the viewer! I’m hoping this game will pass on a sense of urgency—a visual slap in the face that makes you exclaim, “Wow! I didn’t realize that a ‘boring’ minor piece battle was so important, and that it could go back and forth so easily!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On the surface, things look easy: White has two Bishops and would like to open things up, while Black has a Bishop and Knight and would be happy if he could activate his Bishop and find a nice home for his horse. The main questions here are, should White take on e5, push to d5, or simply ignore the face-off between the d4- and e5-pawns altogether? All these decisions are dependent on how they ultimately affect the state of the minor pieces, but achieving the optimum goals proves far harder than one might suppose.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Let’s take a look at these three different options.</p>
			<h6 class="article1">Closing the Center</h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This gains space, kills off the black Bishop’s hopes for an open a1-h8 diagonal, and deprives the Knight of c6. These things certainly sound great, but it all falls flat after black’s thematic reply.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1…Bg5!</span> White suddenly has nothing! Black’s move forces the exchange of the dark-squared Bishops. This deprives White of his Bishop pair and (after 2.Bxg5 Qxg5) creates a new minor piece battle of Knight vs. inactive Bishop.</p>

If 7.g3?! (Note that 7.c5 dxc5 8.Qxc5?? fails to 8…Nf3+ winning white’s Queen) 7…Nd7 (Uncovers the Rook so that e4 is attacked, opens up the e5-square for black’s Queen, and also creates the possibility of …Nc5) 8.Bf3 Qe5 9.Qxe5 Nxe5 10.Be2 Nc6 11.Bg4 Nd4 (There was no hurry for this since 11...Re7 followed by ...Rae8 was also quite good. However, 11…Nd4 shows Black clearly winning the minor piece battle so it’s important to highlight.) 12.Rad1 c5 and the Knight has found a permanent home on d4.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.dxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The critical try. However, it’s not a trivial decision because White has to worry about 1…dxe5, giving his opponent a lock on the d4-square after ...Nc6. Though this sounds impressive for Black, it turns out to be problematic since White gains a bothersome initiative. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…dxe5 2.Qb3 b6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">2…Qc8?? walks head first into 3.Bg4 when white’s Bishops have won the day.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Rad1 Qe7 4.Bg4 Bg5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not the only move by any means, but it’s certainly the most thematic (trading the horrible Bishop for white’s good one makes perfect sense). Naturally, Black would jump at …Nc6-d4 except that 4…Nc6 allows 5.Rd7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.c5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This not only gives the white Queen active possibilities on the a2-g8 diagonal, but it also allows the light-squared Bishop to be active even if it’s driven back (Bg4-e2-c4 is suddenly “on”).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Bxe3 6.fxe3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s quite happy with this. His f1-Rook is suddenly king of the f-file and black’s dreamed of Knight domination via …Nb8-c6-d4 is no longer on the table.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Kh8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">6…Qxc5?? 7.Rxf7 is too strong: 7…Rxf7 8.Rd8+ Qf8 9.Rxf8+ Kxf8 10.Qd5 Nc6 11.Qxc6 and wins.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Qc4 g6  </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Hoping to chase the Bishop away by ...h6-h5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Qc3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Not losing sight of the Bishop versus Knight battle, White takes aim at e5 while also preparing Bg4-e2 when the Bishop can find an active role along the f1-a6 diagonal (most notably leaping to c4 or b5 in many variations).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">8.Bc8!? is hard to resist if you see it. Lines like 8…Rxc8 9.Rxf7 Qe8 (9…Qxc5?? 10.Qe6 mates) 10.Rdf1 give White a fearsome attack. Black can put up a much better defense, but I think the variations after 8.Bc8 are still fun for White. This is an enjoyable line to analyze, but has no place in this book since it takes us far afield from our Bishop vs. Knight theme.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I should add that White has many good moves here. For example, 8.c6 also looks tasty and highlights the sad state of black’s Knight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…f6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">8…Qxc5 9.Qxc5 bxc5 10.Rd5 gives White a huge advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">9.Rd5 h5 10.Be2 </span>and it’s clear that the Bishop is superior to the Knight.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White finally won a minor piece battle</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So does this mean that 1.dxe5 is just better for White? Not necessarily! Black lost that battle because he didn’t do enough to make his Knight challenge the white Bishops. So let’s step back to diagram 73 and show a more principled course for Black:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.dxe5 dxe5 2.Qb3 Nc6!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is more like it! Black <span class="italic">insists</span> on making his Knight an active participant in the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Qxb7 Nd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is how a Knight should be used!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Bg4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">4.Bxd4 exd4 5.e5 Rb8 is okay for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">4…a5 5.Qd5 Qe7 6.c5 Rab8</span> gives Black good compensation for the sacrificed pawn.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 77</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black’s Knight is strutting its stuff</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I should add that after 1.dxe5 Black isn’t forced to take back with his pawn. Here’s a final minor piece battle from the position in diagram 73:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.dxe5 Bxe5 2.c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White opens things up as much as possible. Instead, 2.Bg4 Nc6 3.f4 Bxb2 (3…Bf6 4.Qd2 Re8 5.Bf3 gives White an edge, thanks to his center and two nice Bishops) 4.Rb1 Bf6 is okay for Black after 5.Rxb7 Na5 6.Rb4 c5 7.Ra4 Qc7 8.Bf3 Nc6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Nc6 3.cxd6 Qxd6 4.Qxd6 Bxd6 5.Rfd1 Rfd8 6.Be2 Be5 7.Rab1 Bd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">7…g5!, which fights for the dark squares and prevents f2-f4, is far more combative.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Bf4 Be5 9.Bxe5 Nxe5 10.f4 </span>and here white’s central majority and active Bishop grants him the more pleasant position (though black’s Knight is still hoping to make an impact with …Nc6-d4 at some point).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’ve seen the minor piece battle swing back and forth in these lines. Clearly, the Bishop versus Knight faceoff is important and calls for energetic and pointed play if you wish to see your minor piece reign supreme.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-35" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-8"/>The Two Bishops</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now let’s settle down a bit and take a look at some basic situations. First on our agenda is the extremely common two Bishops vs. Bishop and Knight battle (I consider this to be an extension of a Bishop vs. Knight situation, though an exchange of Knight for Bishop would turn that into a pure Bishop vs. Bishop fight).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Possessing two Bishops is far better than only having one because the Bishop’s main weaknesses—it’s inability to control a whole color complex—is cured by the fact that both white and dark diagonals can now be fully patrolled. Of course, if the position is closed and all diagonals are blocked, the Bishops might not be very impressive. But, in general, the Bishop pair is indeed a nice thing to have and needs to be dealt with by the opponent. The simplest way to remove this problem is to exchange one of the enemy Bishops (either by trading your Knight or Bishop for an enemy Bishop), thus creating a far more manageable Bishop vs. Knight or Bishop vs. Bishop situation.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White seems to be under heavy pressure since black’s Bishop pair appears quite fearsome and is clearly better than white’s Bishop and Knight.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has two Bishops but Black has a central majority of pawns. It’s important to note that white’s queenside majority, though it controls key squares on d4 and d5, isn’t able to expand or transform itself into a passed pawn.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Bd8! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A very elegant solution to the problem! The Bishop hopes to effectively enter the game along the a7-g1 diagonal via …c7-c6 followed (ideally) by …Bb6. Of course, the Bishop might be used to temporarily support d6 by …Bc7, or hit c3 after …a4 followed by …Ba5. All this shows just how flexible the Bishop is on d8.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s a pawn up but it’s doubled, which means he can’t force a passed kingside pawn (White just places his pawn on g3 and the enemy pawns can’t force their way through). So the real battle (aside from King position, which is always important in the endgame) is going to center on the Bishop vs. Knight imbalance—at the moment the Knight is attacking a7 and also has dreams of cramming itself into d6 via Nd6 followed by e3-e4-e5 when it would be impossible for Black to win since the Knight would be too strong. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Fischer’s move immediately addresses these issues.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bd7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The obvious 1…a6 gives Black absolutely nothing since, thanks to the weakness of b6, White can gain enough time to set up a couple optimum positions: 2.Nd6 Bd7 and now both 3.e4 Bc6 (3…e5 fails to 4.Nc4 Bc6 5.Nxb6 Bxe4 6.Nd7) 4.e5 Bd5 5.g3 Kf8 6.Nc8 (this deprives the Black King use of the b5-square later in the game) 6…b5 7.Kf2 Ke8 8.Ke3 Kd7 9.Nd6 Kc6 10.Kd4 and 3.Kf2 g5 4.Nc4 b5 5.Ne5 Bc8 6.e4 Kf8 7.Ke3 Ke7 8.Kd4 can only make White happy since his Knight has become the dominant piece (while King position is also on white’s side). Note that in this last line (after 8.Kd4) the White Knight can swing around to c5 (Ne5-d3-c5) where it completely paralyzes black’s position.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">This kind of structure would usually favor Black in every phase of the game—the holes on b4 and d4 make the Knight very valuable, and Black would be delighted to swap dark-squared Bishops, ridding White of his Bishop pair and highlighting the weakness of the dark squares on b4, c5, and d4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Clearly, the position in diagram 86 is very nice for Black. But what if we make a slight adjustment?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here (diagram 87) we have the same position, but this time the c-pawn is on c2. Suddenly White has all the chances since the Knight can be contained by 1.c3. Using your pawn(s) to deprive the enemy Knights of advanced squares is Anti-Knight Strategy. You will be (or should be!) making use of it often, so look at these examples over and over until the Anti-Knight Strategy idea makes perfect sense to you. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once the concept is burned into your brain, you’ll (hopefully!) be less likely to push your pawns forward and blindly give up squares as you do so. Remember: pawns can’t move backwards, so every time they advance, potential control of squares is lost. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t march pawns up the board—doing so gains space and often makes the pawn a dynamic part of the proceedings. Just be aware of the downside. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This perfectly reasonable move, which gains queenside space and attacks white’s Bishop, is the main line of the Ruy Lopez. But as good as it is, it does contain some potential flaws: quite often White will hit it with a2-a4 when a capture on b5 opens the a-file for the a1-Rook and also leaves the b5-pawn a bit loose. The other potential (though rarely seen) flaw is the c5-square—this pawn can’t protect it anymore. That leaves the black d-pawn to perform babysitting duty on that square, and if it dares move to d5 later in the game then the c5-square suddenly becomes a gaping hole.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has an advantage in space in the center. Black has a majority of queenside pawns, but its crippled since an eventual push to c5 would simply hang material. On the other hand, white’s central/kingside pawn majority is still alive and kicking—if those pawns can get moving with f2-f4-f5 then Black might well be overrun. Black’s unfortunate condition is caused by the fact that he’s saddled with a backward c-pawn and a hole on c5. If he can’t find a way to generate some play on his own (very hard to do if your opponent doesn’t have any weaknesses to attack), then he’ll be in for a long night of suffering.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that while c5 is a hole (black’s pawns can’t cover it), c4 isn’t. Why? Because a later b2-b3 will make the c4-square inhospitable to black’s pieces.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is what Black missed! White is also better after 20.Rxc2 Qf5 21.Rce2, but 20.Qd2 gains a lot more than Reshevsky intended to give!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Now we can see the point of white’s play: By exchanging his light-squared Bishop (which had no influence on c5) for a Knight (which could eventually challenge that square), White ensures total domination of c5 for the rest of the game. Even if Black manages to exchange his remaining Knight for white’s on c5, a Rook will take its place and pour agony down the c-file when White doubles or even triples against c7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">What we are seeing is a strategic exchange of minor pieces that’s designed to “win” an advanced square. Since black’s Bishop is doomed to remain on light-squares, it will never be able to take part in the battle for c5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…a5 22.Qc3 Bg6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">22…Bf5 23.Nh4 Bc8 24.f4 would be just as bad—White would enjoy a marked advantage in every sector of the board, while black’s Bishop would be a non-entity in the coming battles on the kingside (White dreams of f4-f5-f6 shattering the enemy King’s pawn cover) and down the c-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Nh4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A knight on the rim isn’t always grim. This is a good move that frees the f-pawn and also eyes the key f5-square (it’s important because White would eventually like to push his f-pawn to f5).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Na4 24.Qb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Fischer doesn’t want to give Black even a semblance of counterplay. Indeed, if you can keep your opponent passively placed and waiting for the axe to fall, then it’s usually a good idea to do so. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s plight is almost comical. His c-pawn is being assaulted, his pieces are cowering on the second rank, and his Bishop is a Tall-Pawn. Life is far nicer from black’s point of view. He’s dominating the game, his heavy pieces are mercilessly punishing White, and his Knight will prove to be far stronger that the Bishop. In fact, since c2 is the target, the Knight would like to join in the hunt (always do your best to get all your pieces working for the same goal).</p>
