			<p class="caption4">White’s making use of the <span class="italic">minority attack</span> (queenside play via a b4-b5 advance), but Black put a spanner in the works by starting a scary looking kingside attack (via the threat of …h5-h4). How can White deal with that threat?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 a6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bf4 c6 6.e3 Bd6 7.Bg3 Ne7 8.Qc2 Bf5 9.Qb3 Ra7 10.Nf3 0–0 11.Be2 Re8 12.0–0 Bxg3 13.hxg3 Nd7 14.Nh4 Be6 15.Qc2 Ra8 16.Bd3 Nf8 17.b4 g5 18.Nf3 Neg6 19.a4 g4 20.Nd2 h5</span> - Diagram 199</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">How should White deal with black’s not-so-subtle kingside demonstration? Simple—ignore it and send a message that you think your queenside play is more important!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Did you blink and fall to your knees in the face of black’s attack, or did you send a message about the superiority of your own plans? Since this section is about pushing your own agenda, I have full confidence that my 1400 rated readers will show Black who’s boss!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.b5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This move does more than just continuing with your chosen plan (which is important to do), it shows your opponent that you’re not worried about his kingside display and it also puts your own brain on track by telling it that fear won’t be accepted and you’ll only respond to your opponent if there’s a real threat to deal with!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">For those who aren’t familiar with the well-trodden minority attack, here’s a quick primer: White uses two pawns (his a- and b-pawns) to attack an enemy pawn majority (since it’s 2 pawns vs. 3). The goal is to open lines on the queenside (the files allow white’s Rooks to penetrate into the enemy position, while the c5-square can easily become a nice home to one of white’s Knights) and, after a mutual capture on c6, to create a permanent pawn weakness that White can attack right into the endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…h4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black doesn’t blink either. He knows that if he doesn’t get something going against white’s King, he’ll end up defending passively on the queenside forever.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22.gxh4 Qxh4 23.bxc6 bxc6 24.Ne2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A very nice move—the Knight retreat accomplishes two things at once: it allows its Queen to create an immediate threat against c6 (which means that 24.Ne2 was an attacking move) and it also prevents …g4-g3 (which means that it was a defensive move too).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Kg7 25.Rfb1 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 199a</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White knows that he will have the game firmly in hand (black’s queenside weaknesses aren’t going away) if he can prevent the enemy threats from becoming a reality. Of course, he could have chopped on c6, but that would have allowed his opponent to swing a Rook to h8 (after the f8-Knight moves) and pray for a knockout blow. Instead he plays another duel purpose move: 25.Rfb1 places the Rook into attacking position on the queenside while also freeing the f1-square for the other Knight—by setting up a firm defense, Black will be left with no hope at all.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Nd7 26.Nf1 Rh8 27.Nfg3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The h1-square is covered and black’s attack will run out of steam without ever making White break a sweat.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27…Qh2+ 28.Kf1 Nh4 29.Nf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And, by defending g2, the attack and the game are over.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Rhc8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A sad move—Black renounces his bad intentions on the kingside and switches into pure defensive mode. However, it’s a bit too late for that.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30.Ke2! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly Black wakes up to the fact that his Queen and h4-Knight might have wandered too far into enemy territory! White’s threat of 31.Rh1 is a showstopper.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30…Nxg2 31.Ngh5+</span>, 1-0. 32.Rh1 follows, winning the Queen.</p>
