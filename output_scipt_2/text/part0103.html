			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Weak Squares—A complex of weak squares allows a Rook to smoothly slide down a file and a Bishop to do its long-range “dominate the diagonal” dance. A single weak square, situated on the 4th, 5th, or 6th ranks, allows a Knight (or another piece) to set up shop close to or deep inside the enemy’s camp. These things allow your pieces to become stronger than their enemy counterparts.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>At times a square isn’t weak in the normal sense, but it can still be isolated from the rest of its army and/or claimed by the enemy by the creation of an artificial support point.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Let me stress a point that has been repeatedly made throughout the book: Placing a piece on a square where it doesn’t work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Chess is a team game and you want as many pieces as possible to work towards the same goal!</p>
