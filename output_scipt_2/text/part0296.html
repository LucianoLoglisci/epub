			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Nf3 Ngf6 6.Bd3 c5 7.0–0 Nxe4 8.Bxe4 Nf6 9.Bg5 cxd4 10.Nxd4 h6 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.Qd3 a6 13.Rad1 Be7</span> - Diagram 430</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has a queenside pawn majority, a lead in development, and more active pieces. Black has a central pawn majority and two Bishops, but his King is still in the center. Of course, Black will have a playable position if he’s able to castle, so White has to either prevent castling altogether or make Black pay a price to get his King to safety. </p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Black’s King is still in the center and you should demand something lasting if he manages to castle. In other words, you should have looked long and hard for a dynamic solution.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is able to make tactical use of his lead in development and black’s vulnerable King. However, whether you noticed white’s move or not, consider the problem solved if you came up with a similar breakdown to the one above.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Nc6! e5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not a good idea. He had to get his King out of the danger zone as quickly as possible, though the position after 14…0–0 15.Nxe7+ Qxe7 16.Qd6 Qxd6 17.Rxd6 is far from comfortable for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Nxe7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There goes black’s two Bishops! A serious alternative was 15.Qc3, netting a free pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Qxe7 16.f4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Continuing to try to open the position, threatening both fxe5 and f4-f5, and also setting a deadly trap.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…exf4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Alternatives such as 16…0–0 17.f5—when Black is bound hand and foot—and 16…Bg4 17.Rde1 0-0 18.Qg3—winning a pawn—were not very attractive, but after 16…exf4 the game comes to a stunning end.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">17.Bxb7!</span>, 1-0. The threats of 18.Bxa8 and 18.Rfe1 force Black to tip over his King.</p>
