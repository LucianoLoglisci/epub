			<h3 class="chapter-descripton">The Sound of Ripe Fruit Falling </h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Weak pawns appear, in one form or another, far more often than you might suppose. At times the weak pawn offers dynamic compensation—that idea will be explored in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics. However, here we’ll concentrate on the negative aspect of this kind of pawn and try and instill in the reader an overwhelming desire to go after them like a starving hyena goes after meat.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-86" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-10"/>The Isolated Pawn</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">An isolated pawn on an open file (of course, an isolated pawn that doesn’t stand on an open file usually isn’t as big a problem since then the enemy Rooks can’t bother it) is subject to attack by just about everything—the attacker’s Queen, Rooks, Bishops and Knights can all join in the party. However, the defender’s army, if allowed to get active, often gives the pawn’s owner quite a bit of compensation. Thus, a general rule is that the side playing against the isolated pawn should strive to exchange as many minor pieces as possible. This limits counterplay and more or less turns the pawn into a pure weakness.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has an isolated d-pawn but White has created his ideal setup: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>No minor pieces—In many situations an isolated pawn can claim active minor pieces as compensation. However, if all the minor pieces are exchanged then that kind of compensation would be impossible and the pawn would be relegated to a pure weakness.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Queen and Rook (even better than a Queen and two Rooks, which gives the defender a bit more potential for counterplay) is best since the presence of Queens makes it far too dangerous for the defender’s King to come forward and join in the defense of the pawn.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The Rook blocks the pawn (stopping it from advancing), the Queen is behind it, and this doubling puts maximum pressure against the weakness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">These factors leave Black completely passive, and all he can do is try and hold on. He might draw on occasion (many pawn down Rook endgames occur that can be drawn with perfect play), but it’s a miserable defensive chore and most players will crack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In our present position White threatens to win d5 by making use of the pin along the d-file with c3-c4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…b5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">For the time being, this prevents the advance of white’s c-pawn. White can now make use of two ideas (the particulars of a given position will decide which is superior): he can play to create a new weakness by a2-a4, or he can just go for it by b3 followed by c4. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.b3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Also possible is 2.a4 bxa4 (2…Qc6 3.axb5 axb5 and now the b3 followed by c4 idea is still very much on the table, while he can also “massage” Black and just torment his weak points by 4.Qd3 which gives attention to both b5 and d5) 3.Rxa4 Rd6 4.Rd4 and White goes right back to his c3-c4 idea. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Rc8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Otherwise c3-c4 wins d5.</p>

			<p class="float-text">Trade minor pieces when your opponent has an isolated pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, the side with the isolated pawn usually strives to retain his minor pieces so he can counterbalance the pawn weakness with dynamic piece play. However, when the minor pieces do get traded, the defender can still avoid a long night of pain by exchanging all the Rooks.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rae1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The threat of 2.Re7 is serious business, and Black has to address it in some way or risk getting into a bit of trouble. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Rfe8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">1…b6 2.Re7 Qxd4 3.Qxd4 Rxd4 4.Rxa7 can’t make Black happy, while 1…Qd5 2.Re7 Rd7 3.Rxd7 Qxd7 4.Qb4 renews the threat of Re7 and once again compels Black to swap the final pair of Rooks with 4…Re8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2.Rxe8+ Rxe8 3.Rxe8+ Qxe8</span> and Black has nothing since the Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook pin against the d-pawn (as seen in the previous example) no longer exists, while one lone Queen can’t pressure the d-pawn enough to inconvenience the defender.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">If you have an isolated pawn and you’ve failed to generate dynamic compensation for it, it’s often a good defensive idea to exchange all the Rooks, which prevents the opponent from placing maximum pressure against your weakness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now that the reader has a basic but highly useful knowledge of how to play against the isolated d-pawn (and how to try and hold on if the isolated pawn goes bad—namely, retain minor pieces and/or exchange all the Rooks), let’s see if grandmasters actually make use of these ideas too.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">This kind of position is often seen in the Tarrasch French. Black accepts an isolated d-pawn but gets free and easy play for his pieces. As you will see, White follows our anti-isolated pawn formula and trades as many minor pieces as possible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Bxg6 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A slip. With 24.Rd1 (preventing the advance of the d-pawn—a critical part of our strategy) White would retain his slight but long-term advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Qf5 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Offering to exchange the final minor piece and reach the kind of position we saw in diagram 222. I should add that the Knight is very strong here, so Black is facing a “trade it and reach a miserable position, but leave it be and you might end up suffering in other ways by the Knight’s hand” dilemma.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31…Ne5 32.Qb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Not trading Queens since, as mentioned earlier, that would allow black’s King to safely help in defending his pawn: 32.Qxd6 Rxd6 33.Rd1 Rd8 34.Ne2 g5 35.hxg5 fxg5 36.Nd4 Kf6 37.Nc2 Ke6 and black’s defensive task is far easier than it was before.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’ll share a tale here. This game was being followed live on a demonstration board (along with four others) in the event’s analysis room. Two famous international masters were commenting on it to a large audience and agreed that it should be “drawn at any moment.” I was watching from the front row and thought that Black was in for a rough ride—he might draw, but it wouldn’t be fun at all! However, I didn’t say anything since I felt it would be rude to contradict the speakers, who were exhausted after a long, hard day’s work and who had their hands full trying to make sense of this and the other four games as well!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I also think they were influenced by the strength of the player with the Black pieces—they were sure he wouldn’t allow himself to get into the kind of trouble we discussed in diagram 222. But no player is infallible, and even grandmasters can (and often do) fall victim to the formulas and setups (no matter how basic you deem them to be) being taught in this book!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold"> 32…Nc6 33.Rd1 Ne5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course Black avoids 33…Nxd4 34.Rxd4 Qc6 35.Qd1 when we’re back to our main “theme” position. The threat of c3-c4 makes life difficult for the second player: 35…Rd8 36.Kg1 (threatening c4, which didn’t work right away due to the X-ray from the black Queen to the white King on g2) 36…b5 37.b3 Qxc3 38.Rxd5 Rxd5 39.Qxd5+ Kf8 40.Qa8+ Kf7 41.Qxa6 Qe1+ 42.Kg2 Qe4+ 43.Kh2 Qd4 44.Qb7+ Kg8 45.Kg2 with an extra pawn and excellent winning chances. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">34.Qc2 Rd8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Defending an unpleasant position is never easy, and it only takes one “blink” to see it all go downhill. Perhaps Black should have tried 34…Kg8, though he would still be under a good deal of pressure after 35.Rh1, intending h4-h5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">35.h5! gxh5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">35…g5 36.Qh7 Qf8 37.f4 gxf4 38.gxf4 Nc6 39.Qg6+ Kg8 40.Ne6 Qe7 41.h6 and Black is in a very bad way.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">40…Rd8 41.Qb4 is also unpalatable for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">41.Nh6+! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Taking advantage of the undefended state of black’s Rook. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">41…Qxh6 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though it’s usually ideal to retain the Queens (along with a Rook), there are many occasions when the exchange of Queens is perfectly satisfactory, and still ensures that the owner of the isolated pawn will not have an easy life.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The backward pawn shares many of the same shortcomings as the isolated pawn, and several of the anti-isolated pawn ideas also apply to this weak little critter. Of course, the superior side needs to make sure the backward pawn remains backward, but once this is done then we see old friends like “trade the minor pieces” and “pile up with the Rooks and Queen” rear their effective heads.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s backward d4-pawn gains space but, due to the reduced material and absence of the Knights and light-square Bishops (which will soon come off the board), Black enjoys more than enough room to maneuver. Since White has no target to attack, while Black can pound away on d4 with his Rooks, Queen, and dark-squared Bishop, it’s clear that black’s completely in charge. </p>

			<p class="float-text">Place a piece in front of a backward pawn so it can’t move forward.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White threatened to rid himself of the backward pawn by 21.d5 so Black freezes it in place. That’s a good, thematic thing to do, but I would have preferred the less flashy 20…Bxe4 21.Qxe4 Rd5 with play similar to the actual game. The reason for this will be seen in our next note.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.b4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White should have given 21.Bxf5 a go since 21…exf5 gives white counterplay down the open e-file, and 21…Rxf5?? 22.d5 Qg6 23.d6 has allowed the weak pawn to turn into a monster passed pawn. Also note that the Bishop, which was such a poor, purely defensive piece, suddenly (after 21…Rxf5?? 22.d5) enjoys a new lease on life with the opening of the a1-h8 diagonal.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 21.Bxf5 Black would have to play 21…Qxf5 but that allows the exchange of Queens, which in turn lets White safely use his King to give extra support to d4: 21…Qxf5 22.Qxf5 Rxf5 23.g3 Rd8 24.Kg2 Rd7 25.Rf2 Rfd5 26.Rd2 Bd8 27.Re5 Bf6 28.Rxd5 Rxd5 29.Kf3 when White is okay.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black will bring everything possible to bear on the d4 target. Then he’ll play a well-timed …g6-g5 and create a new target.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Excellent! Black plays to create a second pawn weakness and/or weaken white’s King a bit. White can, of course, chop on g5 (35.fxg5 hxg5) but then the typical isolated pawn “make use of the pin” idea is on the table—White would always have to make sure that …e6-e5 doesn’t do him in.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">35.Qe4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A serious mistake, after which white’s position goes from “slightly worse and certainly miserable” to “on the verge of defeat.” White should have calmly held on with 35.Kg1 or 35.fxg5.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has a long list of favorable imbalances: He has more central and kingside space, his Knight is better than either enemy Bishop, black’s f6-pawn is in need of constant defense, his backward pawn on d6 is under the gun from white’s doubled Rooks, and last but certainly not least, he has an extra pawn (though the h5-pawn is a doubled h-pawn, Black must always be on his guard to prevent h5-h6 in a position where the Rooks are exchanged since then it will run for a touchdown).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, as good as all that is, Black’s still (barely) managing to hold things together. And this brings us back to a point I made in our last example, which alluded to the creation of a second weakness: In general, a player can hold when only one point is being attacked. But if you add another weakness to his position then the added defensive burden proves to be too much. This concept is often called <span class="italic">The Principle of Two Weaknesses</span>.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Clearly, I’m spurring White on to find a way to create one or more new targets in black’s camp, which when added to all the rest of white’s riches, should prove decisive.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.a4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly black’s queenside structure will crumble and turn into targets. The immediate 1.Nb6 Re7 (and not 1…Rc7? 2.Rxd6) 2.a4 (and not 2.Rxd6?? Rxd6 3.Rxd6 Kc7, winning a piece) was also possible.</p>

Instead, simply 10.R8d3 would win in a far less stressful manner.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Be2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The advantages created by 1.a4 continue to show themselves. 9.Be2 targets a6 and prepares to bring the Bishop into active play via Bc4-d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Bf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">9…a5 seems a bit more resilient, though it also would lose to 10.Rd5 a4 11.Ra5 Rb4 12.Rb5+ Rxb5 13.Bxb5 Rh8 14.Be2 when threats such as 15.Rd7 and 15.Rd4 leave Black in a bad way. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After 9…Bf4, the rest of the game featured White training for a speed eating contest as he devoured one weak black pawn after another: <span class="bold">10.Bxa6 Rc6 11.Bc4 Rb4 12.Bxf7 Rc1+ 13.Rxc1 Rxd4 14.Rc4 Rd1+ 15.Ka2 Rd2 16.h3 Rh2 17.Rc3 Rf2 18.Bd5 Ka7</span>, 1-0.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Most players have a mortal fear of acquiring doubled pawns. However, we’ll see in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics that they also have their good points (i.e., added control of important squares and space gaining powers).

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, doubled isolated pawns on an open file are every bit as weak as you might imagine them to be (Okay, there <span class="italic">are</span> quite a few exceptions where the doubled isolated lepers shine—those will also be explored in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics):</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In one lesson I extolled the virtues of the Maroczy Bind formation and he fell in love with it. Unfortunately his bind turned into a bust and he found himself with a horrible pawn structure and passive pieces. In such positions the superior side usually attacks the more advanced pawn simply because his pieces can reach it. Thus c4 is the target, while c3 is also being eyed by the g7-Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Ba6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since c4 is the target, Black begins to pile on the pressure by bringing as many pieces as possible to bear on it.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">If you noticed that this creates a backward pawn on d6 and a huge hole on d5, then you deserve a lot of credit—you’re training yourself to instantly spot weaknesses over the whole board! However, White’s in such a defensive crouch that he’s in no position to reach those potential targets. Aside from increasing the pressure against f4, the main purpose of the move is to open the e-file and begin a new attack against e4!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Rf1 Rfe8 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In a way this is almost funny—the poor light-squared Bishop is bravely trying to hold up white’s whole position by getting off the dangerous e-file, protecting e4, and also protecting c4. Sadly, it’s all for naught.</p>

This makes good sense here since white’s pieces are still rather ineptly placed, black’s Queen is still serving a function on a3 by tying white’s guys down to the defense of c3, and it never hurts to have a material plus <span class="italic">and</span> the initiative to boot!</p>

In other words, they are clearly a static disadvantage. What’s even worse is that, while White has nothing on the kingside or in the center (d6 is easily defended, though white’s pieces are too inflexible to even make a play for it), Black will take control of the queenside by advancing his a- and b-pawns.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">English players appear to call tripled pawns the <span class="italic">Irish Pawn Center</span>. I’m not sure why, though perhaps they are trying to give their Irish “buddies” a jab for fun. For all I know, the Irish call the same center the <span class="italic">English Pawn Center</span>. Either way, it’s more colorful than <span class="italic">Tripled Pawns</span>.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Having trips is rarely a positive thing. However, as is usual with all weak pawns, squares are controlled and dynamic compensation can, on occasion, be found. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here we’ll address not the “pile up on the poor trips and win them” ideal (it’s the same idea that we’ve seen with other kinds of weak pawns), but another, more subtle, advantage that the Irish Pawn Center bestows on the opponent.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s a pawn up but e6 is about to fall, which will create material equality. But is the material (after White takes on e6) <span class="italic">really</span> equal? It should be obvious that one can attack trips in various ways and demonstrate their vulnerability. But another problem with trips (and it’s a big one!) is that a single enemy pawn can freeze the whole Irish Center!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In diagram 237 we see white’s two queenside pawns firmly holding black’s three in place. Even if the b3-pawn is captured (as eventually occurred in the actual game), the lone c4-pawn keeps the Irish Center in thrall.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.fxe6 Rd1 2.Rf7 Rd6 3.Rxg7 Rdxe6 4.Rxe6 Rxe6 5.Rf7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So far the play has been pretty straightforward. White intends to get his King into the action so it can help run his g-pawn to g8. Black’s pawns (all three of them) don’t have any impact at all on the subsequent play.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that 5.Rf7 does two things: 1) It stops Black from winning the b3-pawn since 5…Re3 can now be met by 6.Rf3; 2) It will turn the f-file into an impassable barrier for black’s King. Thus, the Black monarch won’t be able to help fend off the g-pawn’s transition to royalty.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Kd8 6.Kg3 Re1 7.g5 Rg1+ 8.Kh4 Rh1+ 9.Kg4 Rg1+ 10.Kf5 Rg3 11.g6 Rf3+ 12.Ke6 Re3+ 13.Kf6 Rf3+ 14.Kg7 Rxb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s now a pawn up and even has a 3 to 1 pawn majority on the queenside. As was mentioned earlier though, white’s one pawn completely freezes black’s three pawns.</p>
