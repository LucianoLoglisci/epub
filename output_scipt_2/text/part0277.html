			<p class="caption4">White has just played his 7th move and has absolutely nothing. Obviously, it wasn’t a very good opening choice. So, what we have here is something White hadn’t deeply studied and almost certainly something Black hadn’t prepared at all—he was on his own.    What is black’s most pronounced favorable imbalance? Once you find that, you’ll fully understand and appreciate the moves that follow.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Nf3 g6 2.d4 Nf6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 0–0 5.b3 c5 6.Bb2 cxd4 7.Nxd4</span> - Diagram 411</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though positive black imbalances like a slight lead in development and being castled while White isn’t are nice, the real answer concerns black’s central pawn majority. Simply put, if you noted the central pawn majority, and if you gave it the respect it deserves (instead of just saying, “Oh, a central pawn majority … who cares?”), then black’s play from this position is not only something you would understand and appreciate, but also something you could find yourself if this position appeared in one of your own games.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think any player 1400 and up who is conversant with the imbalances should be able to take note of black’s central pawn majority. And, once you notice it, you can use that information to find a plan based on that particular imbalance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Our answer is over and done with, but don’t stop here! This game is well worth looking at since it’s a command performance by the late grandmaster Eduard Gufeld.</p>
