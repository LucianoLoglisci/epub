			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has central space and will generally do one of two things: 1) Seek a kingside attack with moves such as Bh6 and Ng4; 2) Place pressure against the potentially weak pawns on a6 and c4 by Qe2, Ng3-f1-e3 (hitting c4), and then swinging the e1-Rook to a1 (smacking the a5-Knight and taking aim at a6).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On a basic level we can say that Black has queenside space, so he will seek play down the b-file against the b2-pawn. However, this is by no means the whole story—there’s a lot more going on than that! White’s d4-d5 has given him a clear advantage in central space, but he paid a price for it: the c5-square (which was controlled by the white pawn on d4) is now black’s, and a Knight on that square leads to control of two other weak squares in the enemy camp: b3 and d3. Once you realize these things (the weakness and connections of the c5, b3, and d3 squares) then black’s most logical move should be obvious.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you noticed the holes on c5, b3, and d3 and saw how to use them (19…Nd7), then take a bow. I trust that the 1400 readers of this book can (or soon will!) be able to find the logical …Nf6-d7-c5 maneuver with the greatest of ease.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Nd7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s hard to imagine a more natural move. The Knight wasn’t doing much on f6, so it begins a short journey to c5 where it will attack white’s Rook and prepare a leap into d3. Compare the Knight on f6, where it’s a rather unimposing critter, and c5, where it’s a mighty Octopus—its tentacles reaching deep (and in all directions) into the enemy position!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.f4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This loses since it not only fails to address the upcoming Knight invasion to d3, but it also creates serious weaknesses along the g1-a7 diagonal—a clear case of a player blindly going about with his own plans without taking anything else into account! White had to play 20.Be3 Nc5 21.Bxc5 Qxc5 22.Qe2 intending to follow up with Ng3-f1-e3 and Rea1 with pressure against black’s queenside pawns.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s the rest of the game with minimal notes:<span class="bold"> 20…exf4 21.Bxf4 Nc5 22.Ra1 Nab3 23.Rb1 Nd3 24.Bh6 </span>(24.Rf1 Qa7+ 25.Kh1 Nf2+) <span class="bold">24…Nxe1 25.Qxe1 </span>(25.Bxf8 Qc5+ 26.Kh1 Nd3 27.Ng4 Kxf8 and black’s a piece up) <span class="bold">25…Nc5 26.Bxf8 Nd3 27.Qe3 Rxf8 28.Nf3 Rb8 29.Ra1 a5 30.Nd4 Rxb2 31.Nc6 Bd8 32.Nxa5 Qb6 33.Qxb6 Bxb6+ 34.Kh1 Bxa5 35.Rxa5 h5 36.h4 Nf2+ 37.Kh2 Ng4+ 38.Kh3 Rc2 39.Ra8+ Kg7 40.Rd8 Rxc3 41.Rxd6 Nf2+ 42.Kh2 Rxg3</span>, 0-1.</p>
