			<p class="caption4">The a7-pawn is attacked. What would be the most natural way to defend it? Does the most natural move work, or does White have something up his sleeve?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+ gxf6 6.Be3 Bf5 7.Bd3 Nd7 8.Bxf5 Qa5+ 9.Qd2 Qxf5 10.0–0–0 0–0–0 11.Ne2 Nb6 12.Ng3 Qd5 13.Kb1 Qxg2 14.Qa5</span> - Diagram 177</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This example shows us that it’s easy to talk ourselves out of even the most logical moves. I suspect that a 1400 player would have played the correct 14…Kb8 right away, but would have missed white’s 15.Bf4+ followed by 16.Bc7 idea. If you’re 1400 and you saw this line, then accept a round of applause!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has just attacked a7 and Black (who has an extra pawn and an obvious plus) would like to defend it. The move Black would prefer to play is 14…Kb8, but girl-brain promptly said, “I can’t” and chose to return the pawn after 14…Nc4 15.Qxa7 Nxe3 16.fxe3 when the advantage moved to White (though she subsequently outclassed her opponent). What could possibly have spooked her? It turns out that she noticed 14…Kb8 15.Bf4+ Ka8 16.Bc7 and felt she was in trouble. Yes, it looks very threatening—both the Rook and Knight are under attack. But since 14…Kb8 is the dream move, you really need to defend it and do your utmost to prove that the position after 16.Bc7 isn’t a problem for Black. Sadly, she didn’t make the effort—the threat scared her and that was that. End of story. Time to look for a different 14th move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, by now you know that a successful player can’t afford to be psyched out by mere threats. You need to turn on your “insist that there’s something good for you” mindset and look hard for the move that will once again make you master of your domain. One way out would be 16…Nc4 17.Qc3 Rc8 18.Qxc4 Rxc7 but Black certainly can’t speak of an edge after 19.Qxf7. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since girl-brain failed to find the optimal solution, let’s try to calmly pose the problem verbally. Since the Rook is hanging (after 14…Kb8 15.Bf4+ Ka8 16.Bc7), ask “How can I get my Rook to safety without giving him time to take my Knight?”</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Put that way, the answer would probably hit you square between the eyes: 16…Rd5! saves the Rook and threatens white’s Queen at the same time. In that case, Black retains her extra pawn and with it her control of the position.</p>
