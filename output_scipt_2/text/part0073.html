			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Whenever you see an enemy threat, your first thought should be “Rubbish!” though even stronger language can be used if you find it sets your thinking processes in the right direction!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, a good player never accepts that an enemy threat will work unless he proves it to himself. In fact, his first impulse when seeing a blatant threat like …Qc8 is to break out in laughter or, at the very least, a smirk that says, “You don’t expect me to buy into that, do you?”</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you prevent a false threat, you are (in many cases) actually stopping your opponent from losing the game! Think about that—games are hard enough to win without you turning traitor and stopping the opponent from committing suicide.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Never believe anything your opponent “tells” you. He’s not your friend! This “don’t believe it until it’s proven” attitude is a trained mental state—you are going to have to force yourself to enter that state by using the word “Rubbish” until it all becomes an unconscious process.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>You’re the only advocate for your position. If you don’t believe in it, who will?</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If there’s a move you really want to play, stick by it and see if that move will still work in the face of the supposed enemy threat.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Train yourself to treat enemy threats with contempt, but don’t be foolhardy! Always analyze the ramifications of allowing the threat before ignoring or preventing it.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable commodity and you don’t want to waste them!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person’s view. By doing so, you will build correct mental/emotional habits and also learn a lot by forcing yourself to peer as deeply into a situation as you can.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If the opponent plays a move that you never imagined, instead of allowing yourself to get confused, seek instant clarity by asking, “How can I punish this?” The logic is clear: if you didn’t anticipate his response, then it must be bad and thus deserves to be punished! This is a much healthier mindset than seeing an unexpected move and thinking, “I missed it! I must be doomed!”</p>
