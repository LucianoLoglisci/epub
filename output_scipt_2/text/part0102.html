			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The idea of a weak square is, for some, an extremely hard concept to fully grasp. While hunting down a weak pawn makes sense in that you can capture it and remove it from the board, a square always remains where it started—it can’t be taken, it can’t be placed in a box, and it’s not something that initially belongs to either player.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One way to look at a weak square is as real estate—you lay claim to it by superior force (money in regard to real estate) and then move one of your guys “in”, thus treating it as a home for a Knight or some other piece. Ideally, this “home” will reside close to or inside enemy territory, thus making your piece difficult to dislodge or remove and, as a result, extremely powerful. This kind of weak square is usually (but not always) “claimed” by one of your own pawns, can’t be protected by the defender’s pawns and, more often than not, is referred to as a “hole.”</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">Placing a piece on a square where it doesn’t work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move<br class="calibre3"/>Find the holes</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Aside from the fact that d6-pawn is a weak backward pawn on an open file, there are also a plethora of holes in the position: b6, b5, b4, d5, e4, f5, h5, and h4. Note that d4 isn’t a hole because white’s pawn on e3 is protecting it (I should add that Black can’t reach it with a piece in any case). The listed squares, though, are the ones that completely fit our “hole” criteria: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Though b4 is a hole in white’s camp, Black has no way to make use of it. On the other hand, the b5-square/hole fits in nicely with white’s designs against the weak pawn on d6—a timely Nd5-c3-b5 followed by doubling or tripling on the d-file will exert maximum pressure against black’s poor backward pawn.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The d5-hole has already been claimed by white’s Knight, but the Knight is actually blocking its own Rooks’ access to d6. Though strong on d5, it would be better served on the e4- and/or f5-holes (or b5, as mentioned in the previous paragraph) where it would join in the battle against d6. The e4-hole is easy to access via Nd5-c3-e4 (once the Queen moves away), but the holes on f5 and h5 are extremely difficult for the horse to reach (black’s pawn on f4 keeps the Knight out of its jump-squares on e3 and g3). Thus, though there are quite a few holes, the only ones that can really make a difference in white’s plans against d6 are b5 and e4, while the d5-hole might turn into a home for a white Rook.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The b6-square is weak, but it doesn’t have anything to do with white’s general plan of pressuring the d6-pawn. Just because a piece can live on an advanced square doesn’t mean that it should.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let me stress a point that has been repeatedly made throughout the book: Placing a piece on a square where it doesn’t work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Chess is a team game and you want as many pieces as possible to work towards the same goal!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A possible sequence from diagram 239 is: <span class="bold">1.Nc3 </span>(1.Rh1 followed by h4 is another strong idea, but let’s keep things simple and within our basic theme) <span class="bold">1…Re6 </span>(Better is the passive 1…Bf8 followed by holding on like grim death as White builds up his army against d6) <span class="bold">2.Rd5 Rf8 </span>(Dreaming of counterplay down the f-file)<span class="bold"> 3.Rcd1 Qe7 4.Qd3 fxe3 5.fxe3 Qf7 6.Rf1 Rf6 7.Qd1 </span>and the threat of Ne4 is devastating.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now let’s look at a position that seems similar, but is actually a totally different animal.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 240</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">All the holes that were so graphically displayed in diagram 239 no longer exist! The b5- and d5-squares can both be made inaccessible to white’s pieces by …c7-c6, e4 is now defended by the f5-pawn, and the f5- and h5-squares are firmly defended by the g6-pawn. After <span class="bold">1…e4 2.f4 c6 3.Nc3 Rd7 </span>followed by ...Red8, Black is for choice due to his strong Bishop, the fact that white’s Knight no longer has any advanced squares to enjoy, and his mobile center which can kick into action at some point via …d6-d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">More often than not, experienced opponents won’t knowingly create a hole in their own position without good reason. Nevertheless, holes <span class="italic">are</span> often handed to you on a silver platter, but you can only get mileage out of such mistakes if you notice how to create them and make use of the opportunity presented.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White has the better position and Black, an attacking player, decided that, “Enough is enough! It’s time to get something going.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…e5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The best move, and the follow-up presents us with a clear look at the sorry state of amateur square awareness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.e4?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A serious mistake that throws away his advantage and hands it to Black! He should have played 2.dxe6 e.p. (creating a hole on d5!) 2…Bxe6 3.e4 (3.Bf2!?) 3…fxe4 (3…Nh6 4.Bf2) 4.Bxe4 and White retains a plus. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…exf4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The refutation. In the actual game Black played 2…Nh6? 3.Nf3 Bd7 4.fxe5 dxe5 5.Bf2 Qc8 and now 6.Qb3! (6.Rab1 followed by b2-b4 is also strong) followed by Qa3, piling on the pressure against c5, would have given White a huge advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3.Bxf4 g5! 4.Be3 f4 5.Bf2 Ne5</span> and Black has suddenly transformed the position and now has a lovely game! His kingside pawn majority promises him good chances against white’s King, and the hole on e5 is a marvelous home for black’s Knight, which rules the board from its new central perch.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If that seemed a bit complicated for some, let’s demonstrate the old “I’m going to make that square mine” mentality with a simpler example.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 242</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s Bishop is a very poor piece, but black’s Knight doesn’t seem to have an impressive home and f3-f4 might give White a little something on the kingside. However, once you fully embrace your “inner square,” the right move will instantly pop into your head.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…b4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">You guys that live by the “Attack his King or live in shame!” credo and who want to play 1…f5 here, should study this position carefully. After 1…f5 2.f4 black’s King has been weakened and, more importantly, the Tall-Pawn on g2 will suddenly leap into action along the soon-to-be-opened h1-a8 diagonal.</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Fully embrace your “inner square.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.f4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This move has its problems, but it’s the only way to get counterplay (you can’t just sit around and wait to die). Even worse is 2.cxb4 Nxb4 3.Qc3 Ra2 when 4.f4 exf4 5.Rxf4 fails to 5…Nd5! 6.exd5 Qe2 and White has to give up.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…bxc3 3.Qxc3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">3.Rf2 exf4 4.gxf4 (4.Rxf4 Nd4 wins since 5.Qxc3 loses immediately to 5…Ne2+) 4…Qxh4 is obviously horrible for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3…Ra2 4.fxe5 Qxe5 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 243</p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Just four moves after our initial diagram and things have radically changed. Now Black not only has a Rook on the seventh rank, but he is also master of the b4-, d4-, and e5-squares. Combine all that with the awful thing on g2 and it’s clear that white’s strategically lost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Qc4 Kg7 6.b4 Re2 7.Rf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And not 7.bxc5?? Qxg3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Nd4 8.Rbf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Still hoping to stir the pot and create some tactical chances. Simply bad is 8.bxc5 Rc2 9.Qa4 Ne2+ 10.Kh2 Rd2 and the dual threat of 11...Nxf4 and 11...Nc3 wins material and the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">8…Ne6 9.R4f3 Qb2 10.R3f2 Rxf2 11.Rxf2 Qxb4 12.Qa2 Qd4 13.Bf1 Qe5 14.Kg2 Nd4 </span>and Black is a pawn up and can also claim a far superior minor piece.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Are you getting a feel for this? Do you think you can begin creating weak squares in the enemy camp? If so, you’re ready to go a step further—let’s take diagram 242 and make a “slight” adjustment.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 244</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I’ve added a pair of dark-squared Bishops. This means that White can now exchange his dark-squared Bishop for a black Knight once the d4-square is cleared away by …b5-b4. One should also note that black’s Bishop isn’t particularly active. Since Black still wants to dominate d4 and should still be dreaming of creating a superior minor piece, the following move makes a lot of sense:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bh6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There’s nothing wrong with the thematic 1…b4, but playing a move like 1…Bh6 shows that you’ve learned your minor piece lessons (from Part Two) very well. Black offers an exchange of Bishops which would once again lead to a monster Knight (after a subsequent …b5-b4) vs. a terrible light-squared Bishop situation. It also tries to turn the inactive g7-Bishop into an active participant in the strategic battle that follows.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.f4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">2.Bxh6 Kxh6 3.f4 b4 4.f5 bxc3 5.Qxc3 and now Black can double Rooks on the b-file with 5...Rfb8 followed by 6...Ra8-a7-b7, or give 5...Qf6 a go (we’ll discuss the ideas behind this move in our main line). In both cases Black will have all the chances thanks to his superior pawn structure (b3 and d3 are both weak) and far superior minor piece. These favorable imbalances will shine in both the middlegame and the endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that 2.Bb2 leaves Black completely in charge after 2…Be3+ 3.Kh2 b4 4.c4 Ra2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…b4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Back to our main theme—the creation of holes on b4 and d4!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.f5 Bxc1 4.Qxc1 bxc3 5.Qxc3 Qf6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">An ugly move that’s designed to block the f5-pawn’s advance to f6 while also preparing to get something started on the g-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Qd2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">6.Qc4 g5! is strong for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Rg8 7.fxg6+ Qxg6 8.Qf2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">No better is 8.Rf5 Nd4 9.Rg5 Qh6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…Qxg3 9.Qxf7+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">9.Qxg3 Rxg3 10.Rxf7+ Rg7 offers White a very gloomy endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Rg7 10.Qxh5+ Kg8 11.Qf3 Qxh4 </span>and White will be under pressure for a long time to come.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are many instances where a square isn’t weak in the normal sense, but it can still be isolated from the rest of its army and/or claimed by the enemy via the creation of an artificial support point.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The d4-square would be a great home for black’s Knight if it could stay there. But White appears to have his house in order due to the possibility of making d4 hostile to black’s pieces via c2-c3. Thus, at the moment d4 doesn’t earn our “hole” label. However, there’s more regarding the d4-square than meets the eye.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other factors in the position: the a2-pawn is vulnerable, the open d-file has yet to be claimed, and a minor piece battle is under way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Nd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Placing the Knight on a great square and threatening ...Nxf3+. 1…b4 was also good for Black, but why give white’s Bishop instant access to c4?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Qf2 b4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“Winning” the d4-square! By stopping c2-c3, Black creates an artificial support point on d4. He also fixes the a2-pawn and turns it into an immobile target.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">2…Qf6 3.Kg2 b4 4.Bc4 Red8 5.a4 bxa3 e.p. 6.c3 b5 7.Bd5 Rxd5 8.exd5 Nxb3 9.Ra2 Qd6 10.Rd1 Nd4!! 11.cxd4 exd4 12.Rda1 b4 is a whole other world—though Black is a Rook down, his armada of pawns leave White in serious trouble! This variation is rather fanciful, though, and black’s logical choice (2…b4) shows a solid grasp of the position’s needs.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Bishop’s not so bad either, thanks to black’s 2…b4. However, as Fischer once said, “You’ve gotta give squares to get squares.” In the present case, the powerful d4-Knight is far superior to the light-squared Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3…Ra3 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black continues to demonstrate his understanding of Target Consciousness. He sees that a2 is weak, so he first freezes it in place (known as “fixing a weakness”) by making use of the hole on a3, and then he’ll prepare to crank up the pressure against a2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Bd5 Qc7 5.Rec1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The idea of 5.Rec1 is to guard the a-pawn laterally by c2-c3. However, the super Knight and the pressure against a2 promises Black a huge strategic advantage. This means that quiet, static play by White will likely prove insufficient. Be it good or bad, I would have tried 5.f4, striving to get counterplay on the kingside.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Qa7 6.c3 bxc3 7.Rxc3 Qa5 8.Rcc1 Re7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Admirable singleness of purpose! He intends to bring all the major pieces to the a-file and break the a2-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.f4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Understandable but too late. The passive 9.Rcb1 Ra7 (9…Qc3!?) 10.Rb2 is a tougher defense, though Black retains an obvious advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…exf4 10.gxf4 Ra7 </span>and a2 fell. Black went on the win the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, a weak square isn’t just an ideal home for a Knight, other pieces can also find that they are wonderfully placed there.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Where is the Black King’s best square? The f3-pawn, being doubled, is obviously weak but one might think it’s safe enough since it’s so deep in white’s position while black’s Bishop is a dark-squared piece and thus can’t attack it. However, f4 would be a lovely square for the King since it’s not only advanced but also bashing f3. Thus Black plays to get his King there.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">9.Bxa6?? d5 traps the Bishop, but 9.Rg1 d5 10.Bb3 is a better defense, the idea being that 10…f5?? allows 11.Rg6 when White is suddenly doing well.
