			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.Nc8!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Benjamin, in his excellent book, <span class="italic">American Grandmaster</span> (Everyman Chess, 2007), writes, “this is not an obvious square for the Knight, but it came to me when I saw 24.Nf5 Bxf5 doesn’t work. I heard Silman mutter ‘cheap bastard’. I’ll assume he meant this in a gracious way—Jeremy and I have since been good friends for years.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I don’t remember making that rude mutter (Benjamin couldn’t have been more than two years old at the time of this game, so the realization that I was about to lose to a fetus undoubtedly prompted a bout of serious angst.), but I can imagine my horror at seeing the Knight plonk itself down on its 8th rank and instantly turn a position that I’d long deemed to have two possible results (a win for me or a draw) into something far less palatable.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As mentioned earlier, Knights usually don’t tread on this rank, but when they do make an effective jump to the 8th there are often tactics at work. In this case the Knight makes use of the single most common tactical building block: an undefended piece (the d7-Rook being the culprit here).</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A bit mean of me since I’m sure most of you were looking for positional ways to use the white Knight. Instead I tossed in a tactic, and a surprising one at that (since 8th rank jumps are rare). The calculation itself isn’t hard, but noticing it is!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Rxd1 25.Nxe7+ Kf7 26.Rxd1 Kxe7 27.g4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">While 24.Nc8 shows a good tactical eye, this pawn move demonstrates excellent technique and a calm desire to milk every last drop of juicy goodness from the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">27.Bxg7 Bh5+ 28.g4 Bxg4+ 29.Kxg4 Rg8 wouldn’t give White anything at all, while the tempting 27.Bd6+ Kf6 28. Bxc5 allows 28…Be8! when Benjamin says, “Black suffers no further damage. With only a one-pawn majority, White will be hard pressed to win.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I had viewed 24.Nc8 as a lucky find, and it was only after the high-class 27.g4 that I realized my young opponent was destined for great things.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27…Rd8 28.Rxd8 Kxd8 29.f5 Bf7 30.Bxg7 </span>and White went on to win.</p>
