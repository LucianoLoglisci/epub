			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.Bg5 a6 5.Nf3 b5 6.Qd2 Bb7 7.Bd3 Nd7 8.a4 b4 9.Ne2 c5 10.c3 Ngf6 11.Ng3 0–0 12.d5</span> - Diagram 196</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is an important moment for Black. White has more central space and, if allowed, will play c3-c4 when the b7-Bishop is a nonentity and hopes of queenside play by Black will be a lot dimmer than they were a moment before. So, how can Black make sure that he obtains active pieces and good overall chances?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One quite reasonable idea is 12…e6 (maintaining queenside options while striking out at the center) when 13.c4 exd5 14.cxd5 (14.exd5? Re8+ 15.Be2 Nb6 16.0-0 h6 17.Bf4 Ne4 gives Black far too much activity, while 17.Bxh6 Rxe2! 18.Nxe2 Nxc4 19.Qc1 Bxh6 20.Qxh6 Bxd5 is in black’s favor) is about equal, and 13.dxe6 fxe6 14.0-0 leaves Black with nice center pawns (…d6-d5 would build a large central front) while White hopes to pressure them and prove that the “nice” center pawns are actually targets (moves like Rfd1, Bf4, and or Bc4 will all be possible ways to prove his point).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Tiger, a very aggressive player, felt he should be able to get more than 12…e6 offered, and he immediately strove to push his own agenda in the most dynamic way possible.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A 1400 player might well toss out the excellent 12…e6. But the move I’m really looking for is a much harder proposition.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12…c4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Taking his fate into his own hands! This move gets his hoped for queenside play under way (After 12…c4 it’s no longer “hoped for,” it’s now a reality!), and frees the c5-square for the d7-Knight. If White retreats the Bishop then Black has gained time, while if White captures on c4 the c-file will be opened and Black gains additional time with …Rc8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.Bxc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game White refused to take up the challenge and ended up in some trouble right away: 13.Bc2 b3 14.Bd1 Nc5 15.Bxf6 exf6 16.Be2 He should have gotten his King out of Dodge while the getting was good. Now it’s too late: 16…Re8 17.Bxc4 Nxe4 18.Nxe4 Rxe4+ 19.Be2 Qe8 20.Nd4 f5 21.Nc6 Bh6 22.Qd1 a5 23.Kf1 Rxe2 24.Qxe2 Ba6 (The rest can be titled “Death by Bishops!”) 25.c4 Qxe2+ 26.Kxe2 Bxc4+ 27.Kd1 Kf8 28.Nd4 Bxd5 29.f3 Be3 30.Nb5 Rc8 31.Re1 f4 32.Na3 Bb7 33.Rxe3 fxe3 34.Ke2 Ba6+ 35.Kxe3 Re8+ 36.Kd2 Re2+ 37.Kc3 Rxg2 38.Nb5 Rxh2 39.Rd1 Ke7, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 13.Bxc4 Black has to make a decision: should he play 13…Qc7, 13…Rc8, or first take on c3? Personally I feel that 13…Rc8 is the most flexible choice since the immediate 13…bxc3 14.bxc3 Rc8 gives White the additional possibility of 15.Qa2. Since I’m just trying to show some of black’s dynamic possibilities here, we’ll settle for the immediate Rook move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Rc8 14.Bb3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has to be happy after 14.b3 bxc3 15.Qc2, when both 15…h6 and 15…Nb6 give him excellent play.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White might consider 14.Ba2!? bxc3 15.bxc3 when Black will have the usual choice between 15…Nc5!? and 15…Nxd5 (which transposes into 14.Bb3 bxc3 15.bxc3 Nxd5).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…bxc3 15.bxc3 Nc5!? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This natural move makes use of the square clearing 12…c4 and places the Knight on an excellent post. The alternative is the complicated 15…Nxd5!? 16.Bxd5! Bxc3 17.Bxb7 Bxd2+ 18.Bxd2 when White has three minor pieces for a Queen. However, Black is probably still a bit better after 18…Rc2 19.Bxa6 Nc5 20.Bb5 Nb3 21.Rd1 Nxd2 22.Rxd2 Qa5 23.Ke2 Rfc8 because white’s minor pieces aren’t working together in any dynamic way and white’s King is a bit exposed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">16.Qc2 Rb8 17.Rb1 Bc8 18.0–0 Bd7 19.Nd4 Qc7 20.Ba2</span> and now 20…Bxa4 can’t be bad, while the building move 20…Rfc8 also offers Black nice play.</p>
