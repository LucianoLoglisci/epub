			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of all the test sections in this book, I think this one requires more from the reader than any other. Be very aware that material is the focal point here, and try to be honest <span class="italic">and</span> fearless about all material (or possible material) imbalances. Afterwards, play over the answers and analysis until you feel that you’re comfortable with the strange goings on. Your rally cry must be: “Material is an imbalance and I’m willing to both take it <span class="italic">and</span> give it up, depending on the nature of the other imbalances.” Doing so will help you make the transition from the “material is king” mindset that traps so many in a lifelong rut.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
