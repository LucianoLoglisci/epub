			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bc4 c5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.Be3 0–0 10.0–0 Bd7 11.Rb1 Qc7 12.Bd3 Rfd8 13.h3 Be8 14.d5 Ne5 15.c4 a6 16.Nc1</span> - Diagram 334</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has built a large pawn center and Black has to do his best to tear it down. To accomplish this, he needs to take advantage of the various pawn breaks: …b5, …e6, and, in some circumstances, …f5. In this position he can’t afford to play too quietly because White is ready to make even more central gains with f2-f4. Thus, energetic play is required if Black wants to hold the balance!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think players in the 1600 class will fully understand that Black has to chip away at white’s center before it becomes too strong. The analytical details, though, are best tackled by the upper limits of the rating spread.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game, Black failed to halt white’s central ambitions: <span class="bold">16…Rab8 17.f4 Nd7 </span>(He should have tried 17…Nxd3, though White retains the better game after 18.Nxd3)<span class="bold"> 18.Qc2 Nb6 19.Ne2 Na4 20.e5 b5 21.Nc3 Nxc3 22.Qxc3 e6 23.Be4 exd5 24.cxd5 c4 </span>(White’s center trumps black’s queenside majority.) <span class="bold">25.Bd4 </span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White’s center is too powerful</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">25…f5? </span>(This loses. 25…Qb7 was possible, hoping to sacrifice the Exchange by ...Rxd5. Of course, White would prevent this by 26.Rfd1 when black’s game would be extremely unpleasant.) <span class="bold">26.exf6 e.p. Bf8 27.Be5 Qc5+ 28.Kh1 Rb7 29.f5 Rxd5 30.Bxd5+ Qxd5 31.Rbd1 Qc6 32.Rd8 b4 33.Qg3 c3 34.Bd6 </span>(Good enough, but 34.fxg6 hxg6 35.Bd6 was even stronger since in that case 35…Bxd6 would run into 36.Qxg6+, which is a stone cold killer.) <span class="bold">34…Bxd6 35.Rxd6 Qb5 36.Re1 Rb8 37.Qe3 c2 38.Qe7 Qb7 39.Qxb7 Rxb7 40.Rxe8+ Kf7 41.Rc8</span>, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since 16…Rab8 did so poorly, let’s look at three other possibilities that seem more in tune with the position (from diagram 334):</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">16…Nxd3</span> isn’t necessary, and it’s not as good as our remaining two choices (you cut down on your options by hurrying with this capture). However, if you intended to follow up with <span class="bold">17.Nxd3 b5! 18.Rc1 e6! </span>(Black’s in full Pawn Break mode!), then you get credit for having learned your lessons pretty well! </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">16…e6</span> is very logical—he immediately starts chipping away at the enemy center! <span class="bold">17.f4 Nxd3 18.Nxd3 b5 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">That’s the way to go after a center!</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Bxc5</span> (19.Nxc5 bxc4 [19…Bf8 is also good] 20.Rb7  [Both 20. Nb7 Rdb8 21.d6 Qc6 22.Nc5 Rxb1 23.Qxb1 Qxd6 and 20.Qf3 exd5 21.exd5 c3 favor Black] 20…Qd6 21.Rb1 and now Black can repeat moves with 21...Qc7, he can go for the gusto with 21...exd5 22.Nb7 Qa3 23.Bc5 Qxa2 24.Nxd8 Rxd8, or he can enter the complications of 21…Qe7 22.Rb7 Qf8, which should be perfectly fine for him) <span class="bold">19…bxc4 20.Bb6 Qd6 21.Bxd8 Rxd8 22.e5 Qxd5 23.Nf2 Bf8! </span>(Both 23…Bc6 and 23…Qa5 lead to all sorts of interesting complications, but I’m not sure that either of them equalizes. Fortunately for Black, the logical 23…Bf8, getting the dark-squared Bishop into the game, seems to give Black easy play.)<span class="bold"> 24.Ne4</span> (24.Ng4?? fails to 24…Qc5+, picking up white’s Queen, while 24.Qxd5 exd5 25.Rb6 Bb5 26.a4 Bc5 27.Rf6 Bxa4 28.Rxa6 Be8 can only favor Black) <span class="bold">24…Kg7 25.Qe2 Qd3</span> (25…Ba4!?) <span class="bold">26.Qxd3 cxd3</span> and Black is fine since the d-pawn is surprisingly dangerous and the two Bishops are very strong.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">16…b5 </span>(Black tries to tear down white’s center in as energetic manner as possible.)<span class="bold"> 17.cxb5 axb5</span> (Not 17…Nxd3?? 18.b6!) <span class="bold">18.Bxb5 Rdb8 19.a4</span> (19.Qe2 Ra3 20.Bd3 [20.f4? Ng4 is terrible for White] 20…c4 21.Rxb8 Qxb8 22.Bc2 [22.Bxc4 Nxc4 23.Qxc4 Rc3 24.Qe2 Bb5] 22…Qb5 [22…c3!?] 23.Qd2 [23.f4 Nd3] 23…Qb2 24.Qd1/24.Qe2 [24.Bc5 Rc3] 24…Bb5 with plenty of compensation for the sacrificed pawn) <span class="bold">19…Nc4 20.Qf3 Bxb5 21.axb5</span> (21.Rxb5 Rxb5 22.axb5 Qb7 23.Nb3 Qxb5 24.Nxc5 transposes) <span class="bold">21…Qa5 22.Nd3 Rxb5 23.Rxb5 Qxb5 24.Nxc5</span> and now both 24…Ra2 25.Rd1 h5! and 24…Ra5 25.Rc1 Bb2 26.Rb1 Nxe3 27.Qxe3 Be5! 28.Nb3 (28.Rc1 Bb2 is a draw) 28…Ra2 are fine for Black. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">These lines are complicated, and even strong masters would have trouble wending their way through it all in an over-the-board game. However, the point of this problem wasn’t the analysis, but your ability to understand the general ideas/concepts in our beginning position—including black’s need to smack down white’s center by using the available pawn breaks. As far as moves are concerned, you can be proud of yourself if you realized that center-destroying pawn breaks like …e6 and …b5 were needed.</p>
