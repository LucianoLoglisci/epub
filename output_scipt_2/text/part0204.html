			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is a pawn down but has the two Bishops. Does this offer sufficient compensation for the material deficit? Probably not; let’s not forget that white’s Knights are very nicely placed, and if they can remain entrenched in the center, will certainly offer White a significant advantage. In other words, don’t get fixated on the pawn and neglect the minor piece battle!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I have a lot of faith in 1400 players, so I’m doubling down on them! After reading all the material on Bishops and Knights, I fully expect players in that range to have developed a sharp eye for support points. However, if that concept is still a bit vague, then Part Five (Target Consciousness) will add more than a little clarification.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As we know, it’s very important not to allow enemy Knights advanced support points (Anti-Knight Strategy!), so the thematic move is <span class="bold">24…b4!</span>, weakening white’s grasp of d4 and therefore depriving the Knight of a permanent support point there. After <span class="bold">25.c4 Bc8! </span>Black stops Nf5 and, after more preparatory moves, intends …f6-f5 depriving the other horse of its central home too! In that case black’s chances would be significantly better than they were in the actual game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s critical that the student develop this anti-support point mindset! In the game Black played <span class="bold">24…Rde8?!</span> and after <span class="bold">25.b4!</span> the d4-Knight was a permanent fixture and, after various ups and downs, White eventually managed to win the game: <span class="bold">25…Kh8 26.Ng3 g6 27.Rxe7 Rxe7 28.Rxe7 Qxe7 29.Qd1 f5 30.Qe2 Kg8 31.Qxe7 Bxe7 32.f4 h5 33.Nge2 Kf7 34.Kf2 Bf6 35.Nf3 Ke6 36.Ned4+ Kd6 37.Ne2 Bd5 38.Ke3 Bd8 39.g3 Bb6+ 40.Nfd4 Bg2</span><span class="bold"> 41.c4 bxc4 42.dxc4 Ba7 43.Nc3 Kd7 44.h4 Bf1 45.c5 a5 46.Ncb5 Bxb5 47.Nxb5 Bb8 48.Kd3 axb4 49.Kc4 Ke6 50.Nd4+ Kd7 51.Kxb4</span> and the rest was easy.</p>
