			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here you’ll be able to test yourself against chess afflictions like Lazy Moves and failure to pay attention. Players in all rating groups can botch a game in the blink of an eye, so let’s see if your chess “spider sense” has become a bit more sophisticated in catching these moments.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">The following tests are designed to give you insight into how much you’ve learned <span class="italic">and</span> to serve as extra instruction. If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
