			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">You studied Knights, you studied Bishops, and you studied the battle between the two. Now it’s time to put your knowledge to the test and see if you can use all that information in a practical manner.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">The following tests are designed to give you insight into how much you’ve learned <span class="italic">and</span> to serve as extra instruction. If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
