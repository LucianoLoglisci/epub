			<p class="caption3">Is …Qxh4 wise?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Bc4 Qh4+ 4.Kf1 d6 5.Nc3 Be6 6.Qe2 c6 7.Nf3 Qe7 8.d4 Bxc4 9.Qxc4 g5 10.e5 d5 11.Qd3 Na6 12.Ne2 Nb4 13.Qd1 0–0–0 14.c3 Na6 15.h4 g4 16.Nh2 h5 17.Nxf4 </span>- Diagram 162</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17...Qxh4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There are a few reasons why 17…Qxh4 is a very poor move:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The Rook on h1 wasn’t in the game, but suddenly it’s handed a half-open file. In general, try to avoid making the enemy pieces more active!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The h2-Knight isn’t exactly a hero, but after black’s h4-capture the Knight soon finds itself doing a praiseworthy job.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black is suffering from long-term positional pressure along the f-file—the f4-, f5-, and f6-squares are all weak and the f7-pawn can easily become a target. He should be doing his best to develop his remaining forces and shore up the defects in his position. Instead the pawn grab loses time and highlights his problems instead of curing them.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Finally, taking on h4 doesn’t even win a pawn! White gets it back in a couple moves and quickly turns an interesting position (after 17.Nxf4) into a positional rout!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Keep in mind, it’s okay to snip off a pawn if you’re actually winning it and if you aren’t giving your opponent too many other imbalances in return. But to waste time, not develop your pieces so they can push your own agenda, and to discover that you didn’t even win a pawn after all (which would at least allow you to drown your positional sorrows in material gain) is simply a disaster!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: White’s reply to the capture on h4 (18.Kg1) is the kind of quiet move that many players miss, and the abundance of ideas in the position makes things hard to assess.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 17…Qxh4? (Something like 17…Qd7 followed by …Ne7, …Kb8, and …c5 would have been far more constructive.) Fischer made beautiful use of black’s many kingside weaknesses:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Kg1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This defends h1 and threatens to take advantage of the undefended h8-Rook by Nxg4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…Nh6 19.Nf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Bringing the inactive Knight into play with gain of time and also forcing the win of the h5-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Qe7 20.Nxh5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not only taking a pawn, but also clamping down on the f6-square.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20…Rg8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This doesn’t make a good impression, but black’s game was already markedly inferior.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Nfg3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The other Knight (which a moment before seemed rather sad on h2) enters the battle and deprives the h6-Knight of f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">21…Rg6 22.Nf4 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The g6-Rook is under attack, but suddenly the h6-Knight is also threatened with death since the h1-Rook is hitting it and the c1-Bishop is ready to pounce once the f4-Knight gets out of the way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Rg5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black didn’t have an adequate reply since 22…Rg8 23.Nxd5! Rxd5 24.Bxh6 is also pretty depressing (though better than what happens in the actual game).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Be3 Nc7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Going down in flames, but lines like 23…Nf5 24.Nf5 Rxf5 25.Qxg4 Qd7 26.Rh7 and 23…f6 24.Nd3 Rg6 25.Bxh6 Bxh6 26.Nf5 were also hopeless.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.Qd2 Rg8 25.Nfe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Winning a full piece. Black could have resigned here but decided to prolong his suffering.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…f6 26.exf6 Qxf6 27.Bxh6 Bd6 28.Rf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Making sure that every piece is doing a job.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28…Qe6 29.Bf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">When you’re a piece up, swapping off all the opponent’s active pieces and ending all counterplay is the usual formula for risk-free success.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Rde8 30.Rh6 Bxf4 31.Qxf4 Qe7 32.Rf6 Ne6 33.Qe5 Ng5 34.Qxe7 Rxe7 35.Rf8+ Rxf8 36.Rxf8+</span>, 1-0.</p>
