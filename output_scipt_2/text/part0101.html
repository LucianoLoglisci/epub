			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>How to battle an isolated d-pawn: </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Trade off all the minor pieces. In many situations an isolated pawn can claim active minor pieces as compensation. However, if all the minor pieces are exchanged then that kind of compensation would be impossible and the pawn would be relegated to a pure weakness.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Play for a Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook situation (even better than a Queen and two Rooks, which gives the defender a bit more potential for counterplay) since the presence of Queens makes it far too dangerous for the defender’s King to come forward and join in the defense of the pawn.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A dream setup (with Q and R vs. Q and R): The Rook blocks the isolated d-pawn (stopping it from advancing), and the Queen is behind it.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Our anti-isolated d-pawn rules also apply to other types of isolated pawns.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The backward pawn shares many of the same shortcomings as the isolated pawn, and several of the anti-isolated pawn ideas also apply to this weak little critter. Of course, the superior side needs to make sure the backward pawn remains backward, but once this is done then we see old friends like “trade the minor pieces” and “pile up with the Rooks and Queen” rear their effective heads.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, doubled isolated pawns on an open file are usually every bit as weak as you might imagine them to be.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It should be obvious that one can attack tripled pawns in various ways and demonstrate their vulnerability. But another problem with trips (and it’s a big one!) is that a single enemy pawn can freeze all three enemy pawns!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you have the luxury of endless time, then creating optimal King safety is always a good idea.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, a player can hold when only one weakness is being attacked. But if you add another weakness to his position, then the added defensive burden proves to be too much. This concept is often called <span class="italic">The Principle of Two Weaknesses</span>.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The more weaknesses you give your opponent, the merrier the party will be.</p>
