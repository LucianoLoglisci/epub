			<p class="caption4">Black just played …c7-c5 and now White has to decide whether to take en passant or to retain his passed pawn and play in another way. How would you describe both choices and the philosophies behind them?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 d6 5.c3 Bd7 6.d4 Be7 7.0–0 Bf6 8.d5 Nb8 9.c4 b5 10.Bb3 Ne7 11.Be3 0–0 12.c5 dxc5 13.Bxc5 Bg4 14.h3 Bxf3 15.Qxf3 Nd7 16.Be3 c5</span> - Diagram 380</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White can’t just mindlessly develop and expect his passed pawn to bust up his opponent. For example, 17.Rd1 Nc8 18.Nc3 Nd6 leaves Black with a comfortable blockade and a perfectly playable position. This means that White has to either take en passant and go for active piece play or retain his passed d-pawn and strike before Black can achieve his ideal setup. The second plan would call for moves like 17.Rc1 (hitting c5) or 17.a4, in both cases trying to create weaknesses in the enemy queenside majority.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I would be happy if a class “B” player (1600-1799) appreciated the strength of a d6-blockade and decided to go for 17.dxc6 e.p. Some will and some won’t, but I also think class “A” players will be similarly divided. Would 2200 rated masters find this easy? No, I’m sure that quite a few would fail to fully appreciate this position’s many nuances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I won’t give an analysis of 17.Rc1 or 17.a4, but I highly recommend the student explore both moves in detail! Instead, we’ll see how the actual game progressed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.dxc6 e.p. </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Ripping open the center in an effort to make maximum use of his superior minor pieces. At the moment white’s Bishops look great, and his Knight will make a beeline to the d5-hole. White’s Rooks can also hit the d-file and add a bit more heat to the proceedings. This is vintage prime Ivkov, who relished situations that allowed him to turn the screws without risking any incoming fire.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Nxc6 18.Bd5 Rc8 19.Bxc6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Else the c6-Knight would hop into d4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Rxc6 20.Rd1 Qc8 21.Nc3 Re8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Avoiding potential Knight forks on e7. Perhaps 21…Nb6 was better, though in that case 22.Bxb6 Rxb6 23.Nd5 ensures White a small but lasting plus thanks to his superior minor piece. An example of the kind of thing White wants to achieve is 23…Rc6 24.b4 h6 25.a4 bxa4 26.Rxa4 Re8 27.Rda1 and Black is under pressure.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Almost all of white’s pieces are better than their black counterparts.</p>
