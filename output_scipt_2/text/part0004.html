			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s hard to believe, but <span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess</span> first hit the scene more than twenty years ago! As time went by, my ideas changed, expanded, and matured, and I improved each subsequent edition with new material that reflected this shift in perspective. This growing process continued and it became clear to me that a vast overhaul in my chess teaching philosophy necessitated a final edition. Those that enjoyed past editions will discover that I literally wrote this fourth edition from scratch—all new examples, all new prose, highlighted by lots of humor and some very original ways of presenting the material.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One thing was true of all the earlier editions: none were computer checked since powerful chess engines weren’t readily available. However, now we’re in a different age, and since the advent of computers in every household allows players of any rating to find the flaws in my (and others) analysis, I made a point of putting every position in this edition though a detailed analytical check by both Rybka 3 and Fritz 12. Though I concentrated on concepts over soulless analysis because I thought too many variations can drown out a book’s message, there were times when I gave lines that I felt highlighted the point I was trying to make, or presented a detailed analysis that simply was so bizarre or exciting that I didn’t have the heart not to include it in the festivities.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This fourth edition is the result of a lifetime of chess coaching and tournament competition. I’ve removed the extraneous elements from previous editions since I wanted to stay “on point” as much as possible. In fact, I tossed out anything and everything that I felt distracted from the book’s real purpose: mastering the imbalances and allowing them to guide you to the correct plans and moves in most positions. On top of that, I also integrated quite a bit of chess psychology into the lessons—you’ll find that many of these ideas have never been seen in any chess book before. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">More than two decades after I wrote the first edition of <span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess</span>, I still get many kind letters from all over the globe. This new edition will please those that wanted more “Reassess” material, and it will also introduce a whole new generation to a system that makes chess far easier to grasp and thus far easier to enjoy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s always been my passion to help people who feel chess mastery is somehow beyond them to undergo a paradigm shift in their chess consciousness. <span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition</span> was written to elicit that kind of experience. If it helps you, the reader, to grasp facets of chess that were previously invisible, then the years I spent writing this book will be very well spent.</p>
