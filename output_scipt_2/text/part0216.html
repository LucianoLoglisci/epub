			<p class="caption3">White is two pawns down. Is he doomed?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though Black is two pawns ahead, he has no chance of winning this game because of the bind created by white’s eighth rank Rook and powerful Knight. Black’s King and Bishop are immobilized, and his Rook is stuck on its third rank in an effort to prevent Ne6, which would win the enemy Bishop. The game should be drawn.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Two extra pawns sounds like a lot, but you also have to take the activity of white’s pieces into account. I have faith that the 1400 players who are reading this book will realize that winning just isn’t in the cards for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1...Ra6 2.Kg2 Rxa4?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Apparently the mighty Portela isn’t interested in drawing with his legendary opponent. It turns out that he had, earlier that year, already drawn a game against Capablanca in a simultaneous exhibition. He played Capablanca again a short time after that—three games at twenty moves per hour—and, though Portela lost the first two (in one he was doing fine but botched it), he seemed to have decided that only a win would do. One can imagine that, at this point, Portela might have thought that he was the superior player and was just unlucky. Thus, he decides to go all out for victory so he can end his series of games against Capablanca with some dignity!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Ne6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Knight takes the first step of what turns out to be a memorable rampage. Believe it or not, it’s about to devour the f8-Bishop and the pawns on g6, f4, h5, and g7!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Kf7 4.Nxf8 Ke7? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Tempting fate. 4…Ra2+ would have drawn. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Ra8 a5?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Playing for the loss, and ultimately getting his wish. 5…Ra2+ had to be tried. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Nxg6+ Kd6 7.Rf8 Kd5 8.Nxf4+ Kd4 9.Nxh5 Kc3 10.Kg3 Rc4 11.Nxg7 a4 12.h5 a3 13.h6 a2 14.Ra8</span>, 1-0. No dignity for poor Portela.</p>
