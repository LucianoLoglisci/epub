			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that White is winning—he’s up an Exchange and his passed c-pawn is about to become a Queen. In such positions (where the game is all but over) it’s important to take your time and make sure that the opponent doesn’t have any threats or tricks. Sadly, Bouaziz, thinking that Black was about to resign, failed to exercise that last ounce of caution that would have netted him the full point.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This problem is a perfect example of a “pay attention!” moment! It should be clear that you’re winning, but by now you should also know that when you think the game is yours you must look long and hard for any potential counterplay so that you don’t botch it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.c7?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, White should have taken a long think and tried to get a handle on exactly what was going on here. I often tell my students that if you move fast in an interesting position, it shows that you’re not enjoying the game. Instead, you should let your clock tick a bit and just absorb the wonder of it all, while also making sure that you’re completely in tune with every secret the position might hold. If Bouaziz had done this, he would have noticed black’s trick and played 1.g5! (giving white’s King access to g4 after …Rxh3) when Black really would have resigned!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Rxh3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After suffering from a shock like this, it’s critical that you sit back for a long think (if you have the time, going out for a breath of fresh air is also a good idea). This allows you to get on top of the position, to calm your nerves and clear your mind, and avoid a hysterical reaction.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Kxh3?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I suspect that White was in horrible time pressure. If he wasn’t, then this is the kind of hysterical reaction I just mentioned.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White could have drawn by 3.Qf1 Rg3+ 4.Kf2 Rxf3+ 5.Kxf3 Qxf1+ 6.Ke4 when Black would halve the point by perpetual check.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">3…Qh1+ 4.Qh2 Qxf3+ 5.Kxh4 Be7+ 6.g5 Bxg5+</span>, 0-1 since 7.Kxg5 f6+ 8.Kh4 (8.Kg6 Qg4 mate) 8…g5 is mate. Poor Bouaziz probably had to be carried out on a stretcher after this horrific debacle!</p>
