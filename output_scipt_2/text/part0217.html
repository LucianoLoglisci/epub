			<p class="caption2"><span class="bold"><a id="A.-Karpov---A.-Kudriashov--Moscow-1972"/>A. Karpov - A. Kudriashov, Moscow 1972<br class="calibre3"/></span>White to move</p>
			<p class="caption3">White has two vastly different philosophical options. What are thsey?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has two problems: His King is in the center and his queenside pawn structure is shattered. On the other hand, Black is hoping to castle and then generate an attack down the b-file by ...Rb8 and ...Qb7. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White must make a big choice: Should he strive to punish black’s central King by opening up the center, or should he keep things simple by somehow taking advantage of black’s queenside pawn weaknesses (which will eventually lead to the fall of the a4-pawn and, as a result, material gain)?</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think anything that asks for the philosophy behind a position is advanced. And when you mix in two completely different viewpoints, then it’s even harder!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Bxc5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Karpov rarely chose risky tactical operations over a safe bind and positional suffocation. And, in this case, why should he? 1.Bxc5 adds to black’s structural mess and also removes one of the a4-pawn’s defenders. Now his plan is simple: exchange all of the defenders of a4 and then win it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Tactical geniuses and adrenalin junkies might prefer the far sharper 1.f5!? when one possible line (just to give you a taste of what White’s after) is 1…Qb7 2.Nd5 Rb8 3.Qc3 exd5 4.exd5 Bd7 5.Bxc5 dxc5 6.Rhe1+ Kd8 7.d6 Qb5 8.f6 g6 9.Re7 with a raging attack. For example, 9…h6 (trying to get his kingside pieces into play) 10.Rxf7 hxg5 11.Qe5 Bh6 12.Rxd7+ Qxd7 13.Bc6 wins.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…dxc5 2.e5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">First one exchange, then another! In the first case White got rid of a dangerous attacking piece and completely destroyed black’s pawn structure. Now he’s trading off another queenside attacking piece, stripping Black of the two Bishops, and also removing the a4-pawn’s main defender. Each exchange is dicing down black’s dynamic potential while also highlighting his weaknesses. Finally, note that 2.e5 is fixing the pawn structure (something Knights like) and also giving the Knight access to e4. In other words, he’s also setting up a position where the Knight is stronger than the e7-Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Be7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Developing and preparing to castle. However, while the black King scurries to safety, Karpov continues to follow his plan.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bxc6+ Qxc6 4.Qe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Every move fits seamlessly with the others. White takes aim at a6, eyes a possible Qc4 (hitting a6 and a4 while also blocking the c5-pawn), and also has high hopes for Qe4 since the Queen exchange (which takes away the final defender of a4) leaves Black in a hopeless endgame. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…c4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On 4…Rb8 White grabs hold of the c4-square by 5.Qc4 when 5…0-0 6.Nxa4 is mission accomplished (White’s a solid pawn ahead), and the sharper 5…h6 allows 6.g6! fxg6 7.Rhg1 Kf7 8.Qd3 g5 9.Rdf1 with a strong attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">4…0-0 allows White to fulfill his plan in a very pure manner: 5.Qe4 Qxe4 6.Nxe4 Rfd8 7.Rxd8+ Rxd8 8.Rd1 Rxd1+ 9.Kxd1 and the a4-pawn is a goner.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">With 4…c4 Black stops Qc4 and frees the a3-f8 diagonal for his Bishop. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Qe4 </span>By forcing the trade of Queens (notice that his whole plan was based on reducing enemy counterplay through exchanges) White ends Black’s dreams of queenside counterplay once and for all. Not only is black’s Queen the “hammer” for his b-file attack, it’s also the last remaining piece capable of defending a4. Thus, trading it also leaves a4 defenseless. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5...Rc8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">5...Qc8 6.Rd4 followed by 7.Rxc4 is hopeless, but 5…Qxe4 puts up more resistance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Qxc6+ Rxc6 7.Nxa4 </span>White was a pawn up for nothing and went on to win the game.</p>
