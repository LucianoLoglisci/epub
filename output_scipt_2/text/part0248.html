			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Fischer’s words (while reviewing Yudovich’s book, <span class="italic">King’s Indian Defense</span>) in <span class="italic">Chess Digest</span>, Vol. 2 1969: “A great disappointment. Perhaps because I had been eagerly awaiting this book when it finally came into my hands in 1968. Most of the references are from the late fifties and early sixties. None from the Havana Olympiad, practically none from Shakmatny Bulletin or minor Soviet tournaments. There was very little I didn’t already know. 229 pages of nothing. I did learn one important thing of value: <span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.Nf3 d6 6.O-O Nc6 7.Nc3 Bg4 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 Nd7 10.Bg2 Nxd4 11.Bxb7 Rb8 12.Bg2 Rb4 13.e3 Ne6 14.Qe2</span>.” - Diagram 268</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The one thing Fischer learned of value from that book (and the position in diagram 268) has everything to do with the creation of a target. Some will blanch at the solution, but others from 1400 on up will, by this time, have fully embraced moves that give you long-term weaknesses to attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Fischer continued: “Now Yudovich gives <span class="bold">14…Bxc3!</span> I didn’t know this move, but judging from the quality of his book, I assume it was copied from another source. Black gets the better of it by destroying white’s pawn formation; white’s attacking chances are not real. Yudovich does not continue his analysis after 14…Bxc3! but after <span class="bold">15.bxc3 Ra4!</span> is clearly right.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This actually occurred a couple years later in the game <a id="S.-Cvetkovic---D.-Velimirovic--Yugoslavia-1971"/>S. Cvetkovic - D. Velimirovic, Yugoslavia 1971. After <span class="bold">14…Bxc3! 15.bxc3 Ra4 16.Rb1 Nec5 17.e4 Qc8 18.Bh6 Re8 19.e5 Qa6 20.Rb5 Rxa2</span> Black was much better but later blundered and allowed a draw.</p>
