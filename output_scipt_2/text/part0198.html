			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has doubled f-pawns. This isn’t the end of the world, but it does make his position rather inflexible. White’s pawn on d4 gives him a central and queenside space advantage. In fact, the half open c-file, the c4-Knight, control over c5, and white’s light-squared Bishop all make it clear that this is the area where White should try and make some inroads. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Other than pawn structure considerations, the main imbalance is black’s two Bishops vs. white’s Bishop and Knight. However, the structure plays a role here too since the pawns are severely limiting the Bishops’ activity.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So the two main bits of information White needs to concentrate on is: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Seek queenside play (an eventual minority attack with b2-b4-b5 is in the air). </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Optimize your Knights!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Optimizing the Knights means bringing one or both of them to an advanced post where they can influence the upcoming queenside battle (remember that your whole army has to work for the same goal). Thus, the c5-square suggests itself. Once there it will hit b7 and, if it’s chased away by …b7-b6, the c6-pawn (which will be sitting on an open file) will be quite weak.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Because the pawn structure favors White, and because the Knights are better suited to this structure, White will retain a small but annoying edge for some time to come.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This is far from easy because White not only has to be able to get his Knight to c5, but he also has to be aware of the Minority Attack. On top of that is the question about …Bxe5 after white’s Ne5. In my view, that’s too much to take into account for anyone below 1900, but I would love it if lots of readers proved me wrong!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.Ne5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Heading for d3 and then to c5. Trying to get the e2-Knight to c5 isn’t as effective: 13.Nf4 Bxf4 14.gxf4 Bd5 offers equal chances, while 13.Nc1 Bd5 14.Nd3 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Qd5+ 16.Kg1 Ne4 is also fine for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that 13.Ne5, in comparison to 13.Nc1, takes the Knight off the threatened c4-square. This means that 13.Nc1 allows 13…Bd5 because the f5-pawn can’t be taken (the white Queen needs to remain on c2 to defend the c4-Knight), but 13.Ne5 Bd5 isn’t playable since 14.Qxf5 picks up a free pawn. Of course, keeping the Knight on e2 has the added benefit that a well-timed Nf4 is still on the table.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Nd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other choices: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Bxe5 14.dxe5 leads to some surprisingly complex positions that give White a bothersome initiative. A sample: 14…Nd7 (14…Nd5 is possible, but it doesn’t put any pressure on e5 and thus gives White a free hand) 15.Qc3 Qb8 (Black’s Queen isn’t well placed after 15…Qc7 16.f4) 16.f4 f6 17.Nd4 Qe8 18.Rad1 fxe5 19.fxe5 is a little better for White since 19…Nxe5 20.e4 is annoying: 20…fxe4?? 21.Rxf8+ Kxf8 22.Qc5+.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Nd7 when 14.Nd3 and 14.Nxd7 Qxd7 15.Nc1 Bd6 16.Nd3 both leave White with all the play thanks to the factors mentioned earlier. Note that 14.Nxc6 is an interesting but dubious decision due to 14…bxc6 15.Bxc6 Rc8! 16.d5 Be5 (16…Nb8!? 17.Bb7 Bxd5 18.Bxc8 Qxc8 19.Rac1 Na6 also gives Black a small edge) 17.dxe6 Nb8 18.Rad1 Qe7 19.Qxf5 Nxc6 20.exf7+ Qxf7 21.Qxf7+ Rxf7 when black’s extra piece has to be more important than white’s three pawns.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>13…Qe7 14.Nd3 Rad8 15.b4 (15.Nef4 is also good) 15…Bd6 16.Rab1 and, as usual, white’s for choice.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Nd3 g6 15.Nc5 Bc8 16.Nc3 Nf6 17.b4 </span>With his thematic Minority Attack in motion, White soon took over the queenside and scored an instructive win:<span class="bold"> 17…a6 18.a4 Bd6 19.b5 axb5 20.axb5 Rxa1 21.Rxa1 Qc7 22.bxc6 bxc6 23.Qa4 Nd7 24.Na6 Bxa6 25.Qxa6 Nb8 26.Qc4 h5 27.Na4 h4 28.Nc5 hxg3 29.hxg3 Rc8 30.Rb1 Qe7 31.Rb7 Qe8 32.e4 Bxc5 33.dxc5 fxe4 34.Bxe4 </span>(I suspect time trouble was at work here. Simply 34.Bh3 Rd8 35.Rxf7 was decisive) <span class="bold">34…Nd7 35.Ra7 Ne5 36.Qc3 Rd8 37.Rc7 Qe6 38.Kg2 Rd7 39.Rc8+ Kh7 40.Qa1 Rd1 41.Qxd1 Qxc8 42.Qh5+</span>, 1-0.</p>
