			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We’ve seen the benefits that an advantage in space bestows upon its owner. However, this doesn’t mean that the spatially challenged player has to roll over and die. In general, there are four ways to deal with space:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Exchange pieces so your limited territory is no longer uncomfortable.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Use pawn breaks to crack his seemingly indestructible pawn-façade.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Try and prove that your opponent’s gain in space has left weak squares in its wake. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’ve already discussed piece exchanges as a means of soothing the pain of a constricted position. Here’s a basic example:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White enjoys more central and queenside space, and he also has a very good Bishop while black’s is seemingly inactive (of course, if black’s a-pawn was on a6 and white’s a-pawn on a5 then the black Bishop would be a true Tall-Pawn and white’s advantage would be decisive).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here we’ll let a couple rules guide us: “Trade bad minor pieces for good ones”, “Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain”, and “Exchange pieces when you have less space.” With so many rules smacking us in the face, black’s move is a no-brainer!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Ba6 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Rb3 Rxb3 5.axb3 Rb8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s remaining Rook is staring at a7, but black’s Rook, by snapping at b3, is just as good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Qc3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">6.Ra6 Rb4 7.Kh2 Qb7 8.Ra3 a5, =</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Qb7 7.Ra3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">7.Ra4 gives Black all the play after 7…a5! 8.Rxa5 (8.Qxa5 Qxb3 leaves white’s King far worse off than black’s.) 8…Kf7! (So black’s King can defend d7. It turns out that Black will easily regain his pawn since potential targets on b3, d4, and f4 make it impossible for White to hold everything together.) 9.Ra3 Qb4 10.Qxb4 (10.Qb2 Qe1+ 11.Kh2 Qe3 12.b4 [12.g3? Rb4 is just bad for White] 12…Qxf4+ can only favor Black.) 10…Rxb4 and white’s once-mighty space advantage no longer counts for anything. After 11.Kf2 Rxd4 White will draw, but Black can play on a bit and let his opponent grovel before making peace.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As you can see, black’s game is actually easier to handle since in some lines the white King can find itself in an uncomfortable situation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Kf7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s King needs to be able to defend d7 in many lines.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Kf2 a6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Though this looks stupid, it’s actually quite useful! The idea is that if and when White captures black’s a-pawn, the capturing piece would also attack d7 if the pawn stood on a7. Thus, by placing it on a6 Black will gain a tempo since guarding d7 won’t be immediately necessary.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-108" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-5"/>Use Pawn Breaks!</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A pawn break is the weapon of choice when facing an opponent who gleefully marches his pawns forward in an attempt to annex every square on the board. A pawn break either challenges your opponent’s advanced structure head on, or maps out its own space in another sector. Here’s an easy-to-understand example of how a pawn break works.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 311</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div class="diagram-os">
					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00314.jpeg" alt=""/>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="SinEater7---DLJ--Internet-game-2006"/>SinEater7 - DLJ, Internet game 2006<br class="calibre3"/>Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White, seeing that he could grab queenside space, has just played c4-c5. It turns out that if white’s a1-Rook was protected, then this advance would be worthy of at least some consideration. However, the a1-Rook <span class="italic">isn’t</span> protected, and thus the space-gaining advance of the c-pawn is simply a mistake. I’ll explain this cryptic comment about the undefended a1-Rook in the note to black’s second move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This kind of error is made all the time on the amateur level, so it’s very important for the student to become familiar with the antidote.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…b6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This pawn break, which directly challenges the c5-pawn’s right to be on that square, refutes white’s idea. Now 2.cxb6 is pretty much forced, though both 2…axb6 and 2…Qxb6 give Black a very nice position. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To understand why having to play 2.cxb6 is a slap in the face for White, take a look at the position after 1.c5. Which pawn is more valuable, white’s c5-pawn or black’s a7-pawn? Clearly, the more central c-pawn is far better than the thing on a7 (in general, center pawns are more valuable than wing pawns). Next, look at the position after 2.cxb6 axb6. In effect, White has exchanged his c-pawn for black’s a-pawn! So, by playing 1.c5, White lost a tempo to trade his c-pawn for black’s a-pawn, while also opening up a file for the previously “dead” Rook on a8! It’s clear that White is a very nice person!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, White didn’t play 1.c5 to swap it off for a wing pawn. He intended to keep his c-pawn on c5 by giving it support. Thus he now compounds his problems with the logical but tactically flawed 2.b4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2.b4? a5! </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 312</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00315.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White loses material</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Believe it or not, White is actually losing material here! Why? Because his whole queenside structure can’t be maintained, and this takes us back to the “undefended a1-Rook” comment. If the a1-Rook was on b1 or if white’s Bishop was on b2 (defending the Rook), then 3.a3 would support all the pawns. However, since the Rook isn’t defended, 3.a3 fails to 3…axb4 when White can’t recapture because of the pin on the a-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s critical that you fully understand why white’s game is falling apart, so please explore this position again and again until it all makes perfect sense.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Qa4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A noble try, but it’s already too late to stop the bleeding. Note that 3.cxb6 axb4 leaves Black a full pawn ahead since the b6-pawn will soon be removed from the board. Also, 3.Ba3 Na6 wins a pawn since it simultaneously attacks both b4 and c5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Ba6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black is up to the challenge and finds the best move. White still can’t avoid losing a pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.a3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Poor SinEater7 is still dreaming of holding his pawn chain together. Unfortunately, his fantasies are about to come face to face with reality.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…Bb5! 5.Qb3 axb4 6.Qxb4 bxc5 7.dxc5 Na6 8.Qb2 Nxc5 </span>and white’s dead lost—he’s a pawn down, his a-pawn is weak, and he is way behind in development.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now let’s take a look at the same general structure, but this time White willingly plays c4-c5, knowing he can’t maintain the advanced c-pawn.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="A.-Kornev---S.-Rublevsky--Russia-2007"/>A. Kornev - S. Rublevsky, Russia 2007</span></h6>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The thematic pawn break. As in our previous example, 7.b4 fails to 7…a5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">7.cxb6 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 313</p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The space-gaining c5-pawn has been forced off its perch, but white’s positional idea is crystal clear: he wants to follow up with Na4, Bd2, and Rc1 with control over the hole on c5 and pressure against the backward pawn on c6. Black, of course, doesn’t allow this to happen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Nbd7 8.Na4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This position has occurred a lot over the years, but practice has shown that White can’t expect to achieve a meaningful advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…Nxb6 9.Bd2 Nxa4 10.Qxa4 Bd7 11.Ne5 c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If White had been able to freeze black’s c-pawn on c6, then he would have stood better. However, the “weak” pawn is anything but the helpless target White had hoped it would be—instead of letting the pawn sit passively in place, Black challenges for queenside space via a second pawn break.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">12.Nxd7 Qxd7 13.Qxd7+ Kxd7 14.dxc5 Bxc5 15.Rc1 Rhc8 16.Bd3</span>, 1/2-1/2. Not a very exciting example (to say the least!), but it does illustrate the usefulness of pawn breaks as a means of freeing a position that’s somewhat spatially challenged.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So far we’ve seen pawn breaks with …b6, …a5, …c5, and (in the King’s Indian) …f5 mixed with …g5-g4. One other major break (White, of course, has his own series of breaks in different positions, but once you master the ideas behind the typical black breaks, the white breaks will be easy to find) is the …e7-e5 break. Here’s a rather frenetic example.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="W.-G.-Hansen---D.-Ciric--Politiken-Cup-1989"/>W. G. Hansen - D. Ciric, Politiken Cup 1989</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5 4.c4 Nf6 5.c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not a very good move since White is going after space before he’s even developed one single piece! </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black had other reasonable moves (5…b6 is our usual response in this kind of position, while the patient 5…g6 has also been played), but 5…e5 is clearly the most challenging and extreme attempt to refute white’s c5-push. This move starts an immediate fight (taking advantage of white’s undeveloped army), and instantly attacks the c5-pawn’s main defender on d4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.dxe5 Ng4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">6…Ne4 is also good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Qd4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White, who wanted to dictate matters with 5.c5, is so taken aback by the turn of events that he immediately makes a serious mistake.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Nc6 8.Bb5 Qa5+ 9.Nc3 Qxb5! 10.Nxb5 Nxd4 11.Nxd4 Bxc5 12.Ngf3 Nxe5 13.0–0 0–0</span>, 0-1. Apparently White, who is down a pawn, simply gave up in disgust.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Armed with all these pawn break patterns, let’s look at a heavyweight example that mixes them together.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="G.-Kaidanov---V.-Milov--Gibraltar-2007"/>G. Kaidanov - V. Milov, Gibraltar 2007</span></h6>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White has an obvious space advantage on the queenside and he also controls more squares (d6 and e5) in the center. If White can maintain his advantage in space while also avoiding unnecessary exchanges <span class="italic">and</span> not allowing a freeing pawn break (black’s potential breaks are …b7-b6 and …e6-e5), he’ll have a clear advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Nd2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black had intended to play for a soothing exchange of Knights by …Ne4. White’s move (9.Nd2) makes this unpalatable.</p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White, by preventing black’s hoped for …e6-e5 push, clearly wants a space advantage on every part of the board! Aside from mere space, the 12.g4/13.h4 pawn-duo intends to sweep Black away on the kingside. The idea is that Black seems devoid of counterplay, which means White will have a free hand on either wing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">However, things aren’t that simple. Though black’s normal …b7-b6 break has been rendered innocuous for the moment (opening the c-file so the c1-Rook stares at c6 seems more than a little risky), he’s poising himself to smash open the center with the other thematic pawn break, …e6-e5.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Pawns protect squares. This seems obvious, but it’s something that needs to be pondered and appreciated since many players forget that as pawns advance, the potential amount of squares they control diminishes. This means that as a player pushes his pawns and gains more and more space with them, he is also potentially leaving weakened squares in their wake.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 320</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">The e2-pawn potentially controls all the squares with Xs. However, if you push it to e3 then it loses contact with d3 and f3. If it moves to e4, it’s already lost the potential to control d3, d4, f3, and f4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, the other pawns can take up the slack created by the advance of the e-pawn. For example, pushing the e2-pawn to e4 gives up control over d3, d4, f3, and f4, but the c2-pawn will take over defensive duty for d3 and d4, while the g2-pawn does the same for f3 and f4. However, if White goes for a big pawn center via c2-c4, d2-d4, and e2-e4, pawn control over d3 and d4 is forever lost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s these “lost” squares that can (and often do) fall into enemy hands when a player, failing to recognize the pitfalls of indiscriminate pawn advances, grabs too much space for his own good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’m going to annotate the following game in a very strange way—variations will be ignored, and commentary as to whether a move is good or bad will also be passed over. Instead, I’ll concentrate on three squares (c5, d3, and f4), how white’s pawn moves ultimately gave them up, and how black’s pieces and pawns are fighting for them.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">We are looking at a typical Benoni pawn structure. White’s central space advantage is obvious, and so is his plan: to advance the e4-pawn to e5 and, perhaps, onwards to e6!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has made visible gains over the last few moves, and 23.Ree1 (which is a form of emotional surrender) allows him to get a firm grip on the initiative. Whether White liked it or not, he had to follow through with his own plan via 23.e5! dxe5 24.f5! b4 25.Ne4 when, for the small price of a pawn, White has created some play of his own!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Space is created by the expansion of pawns. If you think of a line of pawns as a fence, you will easily understand the concept of the territory behind your “fence” being yours. In the 1800s and early 1900s, a big pawn center was thought to be advantageous in almost every situation. How could a constricting pawn fence not be good? However, in the 1920s a group of players (Nimzovich, Reti, Alekhine, Bogoljubov, Gruenfeld, and Breyer) turned this “pawn center is good” mentality on its head. These “Hypermoderns” realized that one could allow the opponent to build away like a demented beaver, only to have it placed under pressure from a distance by a combination of pawns and pieces.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One of the most powerful demonstrations of a center being laughed at and treated like a target is the Gruenfeld Defense. Though this new opening first attracted attention in 1922 when Gruenfeld beat Alekhine with it, it was actually first employed way, way back in 1855:</p>

I don’t know if Allgaier saw this game, but he analyzed 1.e4 Nf6 in 1819 and decided that it was garbage. This opening wasn’t given any respect until Alekhine used it twice in 1921 to score a win and a draw against Saemisch and Steiner—then it was off to the Hypermodern races with various adventurous players goading white’s center pawns forward in an attempt to smite them if they dared to go too far!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position exudes a wonderful sense of balance and teamwork. White has a huge pawn center, but Black is taking aim at it with everything he can muster. Note that he’s not just attacking randomly, he’s doing his best to beat down d4.

If he can do that, then he can squeeze his opponent and eventually turn black’s helplessness into an attack on the wing, or a breakthrough down the middle.

However, here’s another classic game that leads to a different central outcome: 14…Na5 15.Bd3 f5! 16.g4! fxe4 17.Bxe4 Bb7 18.Ng3 Nc4 19.Bxb7 Qxb7 20.Bf2 Qc6 21.Qe2 cxd4 22.cxd4 b5 and white’s center had been torn down and Black enjoyed the more pleasant position. However, Spassky (who had White) played extremely well from this point on, while Fischer pushed for a win even after his advantage had vanished and ultimately paid the price: 23.Ne4 Bxd4 24.Ng5 Bxf2+ 25.Rxf2 Rd6 26.Re1 Qb6 27.Ne4 Rd4?! (27…Rc6! left Fischer with all the chances) 28.Nf6+ Kh8 29.Qxe6 Rd6 30.Qe4 Rf8?! (Now White is a bit better) 31.g5 Rd2 32.Rf1 Qc7? 33.Rxd2 Nxd2 34.Qd4 Rd8 35.Nd5+ Kg8 36.Rf2 Nc4 37.Re2 Rd6 38.Re8+ Kf7 39.Rf8+, 1-0, <a id="B.-Spassky---R.-Fischer--Siegen-ol-1970"/>B. Spassky - R.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">An enormously important move that does many useful things:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It continues the attack against white’s center.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It blocks the f4-pawn (white’s whole attack was based on the f4-f5 advance), which in turn blocks white’s dark-squared Bishop, Knight, Queen, and f1-Rook.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It forces open the h1-a8 diagonal, thereby increasing the activity of the b7-Bishop.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">17.Ng3 Qd7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…c4 18.Bc2 Nc6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black is better. White’s kingside attack has been stifled and his zombie pieces are knocking against their own pawns on c3, d4, and f4 (the c2-Bishop is snuffed by the c4- and f5-pawns). Black, on the other hand, has a mobile queenside pawn majority, a light-squared Bishop that seems more laser beam than chess piece, and a Knight that can set up shop on d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.g4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This loosens up the h1-a8 diagonal and thus puts his own King in jeopardy. However, it was either this attempt at kingside counterplay or passively waiting around to die.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Ne7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A good place for the Knight—it keeps an eye on his kingside pawn structure while threatening to leap to d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Kh2 Qc6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This move speaks for itself—the problem White faces along the h1-a8 diagonal takes on a concrete form.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Ng3 b5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that Black isn’t worried about 22.gxf5 exf5, though this leaves White with two connected passed center pawns. Why wouldn’t White be delighted with such a turn of events? The answer is that passed pawns aren’t very useful if they can’t be pushed, and in this position the d-pawn will be liquefied if it ever dares move to d5. For more on passed pawns, see Part Eight.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb"><span class="bold">24…bxa4?!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black opens lines on the queenside, thinking that he is the one that can profit from it. However, white’s pieces also gain a bit of activity and, in general, one should not allow the opponent anything if he’s bound and helpless. Instead, he should have put this move off for a moment in favor of 24…Ba8! This strange looking retreat actually has a clear-cut point: by getting the Bishop out of the b8-Rook’s way, Black threatens 25…bxa4 when, depending on white’s 25th move, he has ideas like …Rb2 (if white’s Rook moved off of the b-file) or the Exchange sacrifice with …Rb3 (as occurred in the actual game). These ideas more or less force 25.axb5 (or 25.gxf5 exf5 26.axb5) when 25…axb5 gives Black two new aims: he can play for an eventual …b5-b4 push by …Nd5 (the …b4 push turns the c4-pawn into a passer and also undermines d4), and/or he can get the Bishop off of a8, follow with …Ra8, and play for penetration down the a-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game no longer serves our theme, but is still full of interest: <span class="bold">25.Ra1 Ba8 26.Bxa4 Qc7 27.Ra2 Rb6 28.gxf5 exf5 29.Bc1 Nd5 30.Ne2 a5 31.Bc2 Rb3! 32.Bxb3 cxb3 33.Ra4 Bf8 34.Bb2 Ne3! 35.Rfa1 Nc4 36.Ng3 Be7 37.Nf1 Qc6 38.Rxc4 Qh1+ 39.Kg3 h5</span>, 0-1. The threat is 40...h4 mate, and any move of white’s Queen gives up the key g1- or f3-square, allowing mate in three.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Finally, let’s take a look at one more “big center vs. piece pressure” game. This time the center wins!</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Piece pressure vs. black’s space gaining center</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Reti prepares his favorite setup: the Rook goes to c2 (making way for the Queen and preparing to double), his Queen to a1 (creating heat along the a1-h8 diagonal), and Rfc1 (taking the c-file). The “attack the center from a distance” strategy works in the Gruenfeld because Black has an open file that allows the Rooks to join directly in the center assault (see diagram 328). However, here that’s not the case and quiet play can easily lead to a passive position for White since Black can effortlessly strengthen his center, leaving white’s army vainly staring at a brick wall. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Reti’s setup is very picturesque, and one can understand his attachment to it, but Lasker shows that it just doesn’t hold up against his old school methodology. Thus, White needs to add a bit of spice to it via a well-timed e2-e4 strike. The question is, does this have to be employed now, or will it prove to be even better later (depending on black’s reply to 11.Rc1)?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">11.Rc1 has been maligned by virtually every annotator—they insist that 11.e4 was the way to go. Perhaps, but I’m not sold on the idea that 11.Rc1 is, by itself, bad. Before exploring the question of the worth of 11.Rc1 by continuing with the actual game, let’s glance at 11.e4, a move that declares immediate war on black’s center. Black’s possible replies:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…dxe4 12.Nxe4! (White doesn’t get much from 12.dxe4 Be6 when 13.Ng5 is met by 13…Bg4) 12…Bxe4 (12…Bc7 13.Nxf6+ Qxf6 14.Nh4 Be6 15.Rc1 Bb6 16.Bxb7 Rad8 17.Ba3 Rfe8 18.Qe2 and Black doesn’t have enough for the lost pawn) 13.dxe4 Nxe4 14.Nh4 Ndf6 and now 15.Re1 Nxf2 (15…Nc5 16.Nf5 is just bad for Black) 16.Kxf2 Qb6+ 17.Kf1 Bb4 gives Black more play than he deserves. Thus, 15.Qe2! is cleaner, when 15…Nc5 16.Nf5 is a pleasure for White.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…Be6 12.exd5 Bxd5 13.Nc4 Qb8 14.Re1 Re8 15.Rc1 and White has strong pressure against black’s e5-pawn (note the team effort: the b2-Bishop, both Knights, and the e1-Rook all play their part in keeping Black in a defensive posture).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…Bg4 12.exd5 Nxd5 13.h3 Bh5 14.Nc4 Qf6 15.Qe2 and, as usual, black’s center is under the gun (15…Rfe8 16.Qe4!).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">It seems that 11.e4 didn’t offer White anything special. 11.Rc1 though, retains the tension and keeps the e2-e4 push in the ready for a more opportune moment. Nevertheless, 11.e4 is a very important move for our theme. In general, you don’t want to wait around while the opponent’s center grows more and more stable. You need to attack it with as much energy as possible.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Reti can’t resist the siren call of his favorite setup. However, 12.e4! has more pop than it did on the 11th move because Rc1 turns out to be a far more useful move than …Qe7 (which runs into some Nf3-h4-f5 tempo losses). Here’s a quick sample: 12.e4 Bg6 (12…dxe4 13.dxe4 and now 13…Nxe4?? 14.Nh4 wins, 13…Bxe4?? 14.Nxe4 Nxe4 15.Nh4 Ndf6 16.Qc2 Ng5 17.Nf5 Qe6 18.h4 wins, and 13…Be6 14.Nc4 gives White an edge) 13.Nh4 (13.exd5!? is also very interesting) 13…Bh5 (13…d4 14.Nf5 Bxf5 15.exf5 favors White thanks to his laser light-squared Bishop) 14.Nf5 Qe6 15.Qc2 and White is better.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White finally got the position he wanted, but so did Black! Though White is hitting black’s center from a distance and also controls the c-file, all is not well in Boonsville. The problem is that his pawn-strikes against the center no longer work, and he can’t up the pressure in any meaningful way. As for the c-file, all the penetration squares are well covered. This means that White has driven down a dead-end street.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Bh7 16.Nf1 Nc5! 17.Rxc5!? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White, who realizes that he’s been outplayed by Lasker and that things have turned sour, employs an Exchange sacrifice in order to imbalance the position and give himself something to crow about. Defensive moves such as 17.N3d2 and 17.Qa2 are met by 17…Na6 followed by 18…Nb4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Bxc5 18.Nxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s gotten a pawn for the Exchange, his dark-squared Bishop is slicing down the newly opened a1-h8 diagonal, and black’s once mighty center has been dismantled. However, black’s position is solid, his pieces are well placed, both his Rooks will contribute down the c- and e-files, and he’s material ahead. Thus, White doesn’t have full compensation for the Exchange.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…Rac8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">18…Bd6, forcing White to loosen up the e-file and the g1-a7 diagonal with 19.f4, was also good.</p>

Black had several good moves (The tightening 20…b6, the greedy 20…Bxe3 21.fxe3 Qb6 22.Bd4 Qxb3 23.Rb1 Qc2 24.Rxb7 Qxe2, and 20…h5, which takes the g4-square away from the white Knights). However, best might have been 20…Qd6! when 21.d4 blocks his b2-Bishop and activates black’s h7-Bishop, while 21.Kh2 falls victim to 21…Bxe3 22.Rxc8 (22.fxe3 Rxc1 23.Qxc1 Rxe5 leaves Black with an extra piece) 22…Rxc8 23.fxe3 Rc2 and the threats of 24…Rxe2 and 24…Qb6 hitting both b3 and e3 give Black a winning game.</p>
