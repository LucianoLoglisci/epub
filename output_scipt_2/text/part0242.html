			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I would think that “one final trick” would act as a huge hint. The move I’m after doesn’t work, but it’s far better than resigning since it gives you one final shot at salvation. Would most 1400 players notice this stalemate and set up the trap? Probably not, but I’m hoping that the 1400 players reading this book will!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s a Rook and a pawn down, so it’s completely hopeless. However, since resignation is an option that will always be available, Black finds one last trap:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…f3+! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Why not give this a go? If white’s not paying attention, he might snap it off with 2.Qxf3?? when 2…Qg1+ 3.Kh3 Qh2+ 4.Kxh2 is a stalemate. Even more unfortunate for White is 2.Kxf3?? Qf1+ winning white’s Queen! Finally, 2.exf3?? Qg1+ 3.Kh3?? (3.Kxg1, =) 3…Qh1 mate would, to put it mildly, completely spoil white’s day.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Kf2</span>, 1-0. It’s important that you find tricks like this when things are turning sour (people will fall into them more often than you might imagine), and equally important (if you’re the stronger side) to avoid quick moves; instead you should calmly look around and do your best to discover what your opponent is up to.</p>
