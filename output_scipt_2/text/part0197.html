			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bg5 Ne4 5.Bh4 c5 6.cxd5 Nxc3 7.bxc3 Qxd5 8.e3 cxd4 9.Qxd4 Qxd4 10.cxd4 e6 11.Rb1 Be7 12.Bxe7 Kxe7 13.Bd3 Nc6 14.Nf3 b6 15.Ke2 Bb7 16.Rhc1 Rhc8 - </span>Diagram 72</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The main imbalance in this position is the battle between white’s central pawn majority and black’s queenside pawn majority. Many amateurs are programmed to quake in their boots when they realize their opponent has a queenside majority—“Isn’t that a big advantage?” they ask. It can be, but center pawns tend to be more valuable in the middlegame and in positions where quite a few pieces still remain on the board. And, as we can readily see, white’s center pawns give him a spatial plus (it’s nothing huge, but it’s something!).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, there’s another battle going on here too: the battle of the Bishops! White has noticed that black’s center and kingside pawns are all on light squares. If this were permanent, such a state of affairs would bode well for white’s Bishop since the enemy pawns would be potential targets. Thus, White plays to fix the enemy pawns on light squares.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This is all about finding subtle ways to create things that don’t yet exist. Very advanced, which explains the rating spread.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.g4!  </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Excellent! White intends g4-g5 and there’s no convenient way to stop it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…h6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other choices:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>17…f5 18.gxf5 gxf5 19.Rg1 (Another choice is 19.d5 exd5 20.Rg1 [Much worse is 20.Bxf5 Ba6+] 20…Rg8 21.Nh4 Ne5 22.Nxf5+ Kf6 23.Nd4 Nxd3 24.Kxd3 with a very nice endgame for White) 19…Rg8 20.Rg3 Rxg3 21.hxg3 with a small but pleasant structural edge (three pawn islands to two, and weaknesses on h7, e6, and a hole on e5).</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>17…f6 18.g5 f5 19.h4 when White has achieved his aim of fixing black’s central and kingside pawns on light squares.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.h4 Na5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The alternative was 18…Rc7 19.g5 Rac8 (threatening …Nxd4+. The immediate 19…hxg5 20.hxg5 Rac8 21.Rh1! correctly announces that the h-file is far more important that the c-file) 20.Kd2 and now 20…h5 is a real success for White since black’s kingside pawns are permanently stuck on light squares. Instead, 20…hxg5 21.hxg5 Nb4 (21…Na5 22.Ne5 leads to the same kind of positions that occur in the game) 22.Rxc7+ Rxc7 23.Rxb4 Bxf3 24.e4 with a position that’s still rather uncomfortable for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">19.g5 hxg5 20.hxg5 Rxc1 21.Rxc1 Rc8 22.Rxc8 Bxc8 23.Ne5</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black was hoping that the exchange of all the Rooks would ease his defensive chore, but the superiority of the white Knight and Bishop over their black counterparts, plus the fact that black’s pawns have been stuck on light squares, is a guarantee that Black still has a lot of suffering to go through.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Bb7 24.a3 Nc6 25.Ng4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since black’s position is quite passive, White retains the Knights (only to offer the trade at the best possible moment) and proceeds to improve the position of his King and gobble up as much central space with his pawns as possible. There’s no hurry, and as I’ve said before: When you have an opponent passively waiting for his fate, take your time and improve your position as much as possible before undertaking any committal action. This isn’t to say that Black is lost here, but his position is far from easy to defend.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Nb8 26.Kd2 Bc6 27.Kc3 Nd7 28.f4 a5 29.e4 b5 30.Bc2 f5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black cracks. He should have played 30…f6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31.exf5 exf5 32.Ne5 Nxe5 33.dxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly black’s position is hopeless. His kingside pawns are still on light squares, but now White has a protected passed pawn and an easy route into black’s position via Kc3-d4-c5. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">33…b4+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Material would have been lost anyway after the King made its way to c5. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">34.axb4 axb4+ 35.Kxb4 Bd7 36.Bb3 Bc6 37.Kc5 Be8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This makes it easy for White. Black had to try 37…Bf3, when a theoretical (and complex) position is reached that is supposed to be winning. Of course, this kind of thing is far outside the scope of this book. Suffice it to say that White mixes threats against g6 (Bg8-h7) with a well-timed e5-e6 advance and decisive King breakthroughs to gain the full point. Note that all this is possible because black’s pawns are on light squares and thus vulnerable to the enemy Bishop. The plan initiated with g2-g4-g5 has been a resounding success!  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">38.e6</span>, 1-0. The end might have been 38…Kf8 39.Kd6 Bb5 40.e7+ Ke8 41.Bd5 Ba4 42.Bc4! Bd7 43.Bf7+ and that’s all she wrote.</p>
