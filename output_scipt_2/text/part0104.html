			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">For most amateurs, the enemy King is the main target from the first move onwards. However, viewing chess in that way puts blinders over your eyes that not only hampers you from fully embracing new skills and ideas, but also prevents you from appreciating all the subtle, often extremely beautiful, plans and/or strategies in master chess that often have absolutely nothing to do with an attack against the opposing King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So far we’ve seen a quite a few compelling examples of this positional approach in our study of Target Consciousness (squares and weak pawns), and that same strategic view (imbalances) is more or less the subject of this whole book. But now we’re going to address when a player <span class="italic">must</span> push positional niceties out the window and go after the King. It’s important to take note of the word “must.” By “must,” I mean that the imbalances are demanding (or perhaps begging, if you rarely obey the imbalances’ voice) that you take this particular course. Thus we won’t be exploring gambit openings that lead to kingside attacks. Nor will we be studying how to slowly but surely build up for a kingside or queenside assault (countless other books cover “attacking the King” very well). Instead, we’ll look at the single most common example (in amateur chess) of a King begging to die: the uncastled, central King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though there are other “must attack” cases, I’m going to concentrate on this one because it’s my experience that amateurs tend to leave their King in the center far too long. I see it all the time in scholastic events, and even players as high as 2000 often “forget” to castle. One gentleman I taught with a 1400 rating simply refused to castle, saying that he was sure his castled King would be surrounded in a corner and mated. So he kept his King in the middle and, predictably, got mated there in game after game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Our basic thesis is this: If your King is safely castled while the opponent’s is in the middle of the board, I want you to train your mind to view that central King as a target, and immediately try and ascertain whether there’s a way to smite it. At the very least, active play in the center while the enemy’s monarch resides there will allow you to make some important gains as he scrambles to get his King to safety.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here are a few short games by the author that should serve as a warning to those that put off castling, while also showing what one should do if the opponent keeps his King in the center for too long.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black, a victim of a botched opening, is already lost: his pieces are inactive, White possesses a huge space advantage in the center, and (I’m sure you were waiting for this!) black’s King is still sitting in the middle as if nothing bad could possibly happen to it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.Ng3 h5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black doesn’t realize that he can’t win a battle if his King is hanging out to dry while white’s is safely out of the line of fire on the kingside. Other things being equal, the side with the vulnerable King will always come in second in a head to head clash. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Unfortunately for Black, 12…0–0 13.Bxg5 Qxg5 14.Bxh7+ Kh8 15.f4 is also absolutely awful for him.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Nef8 15.Qe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is dying to crack open some files and diagonals so he can roast the enemy King. 15.Qe2 prepares e5-e6 while also watching the h5-square (it allows him to meet 15…h4 with the very strong 16.Nh5).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Qe7 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The storm breaks, white’s pieces stream into the enemy position, and the game ends in a river of blood.</p>

It’s now clear that black’s dark-squared Bishop was far more important than white’s Rook – it was the defender of the dark squares and now, with it gone, the a1-h8 diagonal will act as a road for white’s Queen which can leap right into the heart of the enemy position.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The position is a disaster for White – he’s way behind in development, black’s King is safely tucked away on g8, and white’s King is sitting in the middle, uncastled and forlorn. By now the reader should know the drill: 1) Seeing that the enemy King has stayed in the center for too long, immediately get excited and target it for destruction; 2) Don’t allow him to castle to safety; 3) Bring as many pieces to the embattled area as possible and prepare some form of decisive penetration; 4) Rip open some lines and go for the throat!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">All of this starts with a simple act of recognition: you train yourself to see red when the enemy King is in the middle, you label it as a target, and then you play with as much energy as possible to take advantage of the situation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Ne5 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Be2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s too late to castle: 14.0-0 Nf3+ 15.Nxf3 Bxf3 (threatening mate on h2) 16.h3 Qg6 (threatening mate on g2) 17.g4 (17.g3 Bxg3) 17…Nxg4 when White will soon be mated.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Any capture on f5 allows 18…Qd1 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Qf3 Bd3+</span>, 0-1. Both 19.Qxd3 Qd1 and 19.Kg1 Re1 are mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, a central King isn’t always a death sentence. For example, if the center is closed, then a longer than usual stay in the middle might be acceptable since the enemy pieces can’t get into the offending position. And, at times, players of all levels (even grandmasters) will temporarily put off castling since they feel they can make serious gains with other moves. Sometimes this works, and sometimes the sky falls on their head. Either way, a player who has cultivated Target Consciousness will instantly be aware of the situation and will look hard for a way to punish his opponent’s concept. If you can’t punish it, then the opponent’s idea is playable and you just go ahead with the game in a normal fashion. However, often you <span class="italic">can</span> punish the central King, and when the King hunt starts, the fun begins.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that going after a central King can pay dividends, but at times the correct path isn’t to sound an immediate charge, but to make sure the King remains in the center for as long as possible. The following example is a case in point.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’ll finish our theoretical discussion of “The central King as a Target” by sharing a tale about Micky Mills, a class “C” player (1500) who, way back in 1974, had a very poor grasp of attacking fundamentals. I was his teacher and, seeing this flaw, recommended that he read <span class="italic">The Art of Attack</span> by Vukovic.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Some months after my recommendation, Mills was playing in an open tournament (players of every rating were mixed together) that happened to have a brilliancy prize. There were quite a few strong players, including the U.S. Champion John Grefe and many time U.S. Champion Walter Browne, so everyone expected one of the “big guns” to pick up that cash bonus.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mills was not doing particularly well in the event, and was paired with another “C” player. Nobody paid much attention to the game, but after I got home (with Mills, two Senior Masters [2400], and John Grefe in tow) Micky squealed, “Look at my game! Look at my game! I’ve played a brilliancy!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’m not proud of this, but I have to admit that we all burst into laughter. “Okay,” we said in our most sarcastic tone, “show it to us!”</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Desperate to find something to criticize, we all became hysterical. “You fool!” we howled, “Why did you allow him to attack your Bishop with gain of time?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“Well,” Michael replied coolly, “I was trying to egg him on.” This was too much for us. We fell on the floor and laughed uncontrollably. Undaunted, Michael ploughed ahead and simply ignored us.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">At this point I must ask the reader if he has noticed the flaws in white’s position? One big problem is that e5 is weak and if that pawn vanishes, then the g7-Bishop will rule the a1-h8 diagonal. However, the other problem is the reason this example is being presented here: white’s King is still in the center!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Be6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We were too busy making fun of Michael to notice 13...Bxe5! 14.Bh6 (14.gxf5 d4) 14...d4! 15.Qe2 (15.Bxf8 dxc3 is grim for White, but 15.Na4 keeps the game going) 15…Bf6 16.Bxf8 dxc3 17.b3 Qd2+ 18.Qxd2 cxd2+ 19.Kxd2 Kxf8 20.gxf5 Rd8+ 21.Ke2 Bxa1 22.Rxa1 gxf5 and Black is a pawn up in the endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Qd4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The idea of this move (other than the fact that it defends e5) is to post the Queen on c5—not a bad concept, but it walks into various tactical problems. Far better was 14.f4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…f6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A good move that tries to rip open the center and get at the uncastled King, but interesting alternatives existed:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>14...Qb8 creates a double attack against b2 and e5.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>14...Rc8!? is a wacky computer move: 15.Qxa7 (15.Na4 Qc7) 15...Bxe5 16.Bh6 d4 17.Rd1 Ra8 18.Qc5 Qc7 19.Bxf8 dxc3 20.Bxe7 cxb2 21.0-0 Bxa2 and White is getting wiped out.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.f4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very poor. White should play 15.exf6 when 15…Bxf6 leaves Black better, but it’s still a fight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Qc7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We ribbed Mills for not playing 15...fxe5 16.fxe5 Qc7, which nets a free pawn since 17.Bf4 c5 is crushing. However, the text move also leaves White in a bad way, and might even prove stronger than 15…fxe5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Qc5 Bh4+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">More straightforward is 17...d4 18.Bxd4 Qxf4 19.Bxf6 Rxf6 with a winning attack. The path Mills chose is far deeper and far more elegant.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Ke2 </span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">A magnificent move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This first-rate move, which is beyond the powers of the present crop (early 2010) of computers, sets up …Ba6+ possibilities and also frees the e-pawn, which can now advance to e5 and nuke the center (going after that central enemy King). Michael’s earlier moves had not made much of an impression on us, but when we saw this move our pompous smiles began to fade.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Nxd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very tempting and very greedy, but there really isn’t a fully acceptable defense. Other tries:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.Kd2 Ba6 (intending both ...d4 and ...Rxf4) 20.Rad1 (20.Kc1!?) and now 20...Rxf4 leads to fascinating tactics, but 20…e5 is simple and probably best: 21.fxe5 d4 22.Bxd4 Rfd8 23.Kc1 Be7 and Black wins a piece.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.b4 e5 20.fxe5 Qxe5 looks grim.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.Rag1 Ba6+ 20.Kd1 e5 and all I can say is that I wouldn’t want to be White.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.Kf3 and now both 19…Bb7 (20.Nxd5 Qe5 21.Nc3 Rxf4+) and 19...Ba6 are strong.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19...Ba6+ 20.c4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has many possibilities after 20.Kf3, the simplest of which is 20...Qe5 when White has to jettison a piece by 21.Nxe7+ (21.Qxc6 Rac8 is game over) 21...Qxe7 22.Qxe7 Bxe7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20...Qb7! 21.Nb4 e5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s holding on as best he can, but Mills (who appears to be channeling Alekhine) won’t stop playing great moves!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">At this point we were no longer saying anything. Instead we silently watched the game unfold as Mills made comments like, “His King in the center and I have to get it!” and “I’m busting open the center so that my pieces can penetrate!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">22.Nxa6</span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Channeling Alekhine</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other moves were a bit better but still depressing from white’s point of view. For example, 22.f5 Be7 23.Qxc6 Bxb4 is an extra piece for Black, 22.a3 exf4 is fun for only one side, and 22.fxe5 Be7 23.Qxc6 Qxb4 gives Black an extra piece and an attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22...exf4?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black learned that he’s supposed to open lines in this kind of position and he’s making sure he does it! Unfortunately, more direct measures were called for: 22...Qxb2+ 23.Bd2 (23.Kf3 e4+ is horrific) 23…Rxf4! and White is dead lost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Bd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Worse is 23.Bd2 f3+ 24.Kd1 Qxb2 25.Rc1 Rad8</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23...Rae8+? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The most natural move in the world, but it turns out to be inaccurate. Instead, 23...f3+ is quite strong: 24.Kd3 Rad8 25.Nb4 Be7 (the immediate 25...Rxd4+ is also good) 26.Qe5 Rxd4+ 27.Qxd4 Qxb4 28.Qc3 Qc5 29.Kc2 Rf4 30.b4 Qf2+ 31.Kb3 Bf6 32.Raf1 Qe2 33.Qc2 Qe3+ 34.Ka4 f2 gives Black a winning advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.Kf3?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Kindly allowing a stunning finish. White had to play 24.Kd3 when 24...Qxa6 25.Qxa7 Qxa7 26.Bxa7 f3 27.Bc5 Rf7 28.Rad1 Rd7+ 29.Kc2 Re2+ still leaves White in serious trouble due to the power of the passed f-pawn and the vulnerability of the white King. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After this final mistake by White, Mills really does turn into Alekhine!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">24...Re3+!!</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Kg2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 25.Bxe3 fxe3+ 26.Ke4, Black would be able to choose from a multitude of winning ideas, with 26...Re8+ 27.Kd3 Rd8+ 28.Ke4 Qxb2 being my personal favorite.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25...f3+ 26.Kf1 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Kg1 Bg3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Tightening the net around white’s King. The Rook is still immune to capture—an incredible situation. Of course, 27...Re1+ also won easily.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“Who was that masked grandmaster?” Larry Christiansen asked when I showed him the game some months later.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What’s of particular interest to me is that Mills didn’t offer any variations at all as he was playing through the game (nor was he able to defend his moves with actual variations). Instead, he would explain everything he did by naming a pattern that he learned from the aforementioned Vukovic book. Thus we were pelted by verbal nutshells of wisdom like, “Central King, kill it!” and “Ripping open the center!” and “Maximizing the activity of my pieces!” and “Sacrificing to open lines to his King!” and “It’s a double attack!” and “I’m building a mating net!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, Mills won the brilliancy prize, and none of us could do anything but applaud him. Few players (of any rating) ever create an evergreen such as this, so he can consider himself blessed. It’s truly a fantastic creative effort and, perhaps, the greatest game by a non-master of all time! </p>
