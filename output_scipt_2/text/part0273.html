			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 0–0 5.Bd3 c5 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Nc6 8.Ne2 d6 9.0–0 e5 10.e4 Re8 11.Qc2 Nd7 12.f4 b6 13.Be3 Ba6 14.fxe5 dxe5 15.d5 Na5 16.Qa2 Nf8 17.Ng3 Ng6 18.Qe2 Nb7 19.Nf5 Nd6 20.g3 f6 21.Nxd6 Qxd6 22.h4</span> - Diagram 382</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If your first impression was, “White has a passed d-pawn and I would love to blockade it with my Knight. How can I accomplish that?” then you did very well. If you also noticed that c4 is weak and that a Knight on d6 would add to the pressure against that point (not to mention e4), then that’s even better. And, finally, if you thought that Black has a great game (despite the d-pawn) while also noting that you would love to answer a3-a4 with …a5, then you’re nothing less than a hero!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: It’s one thing to know you want a horse on d6, but it’s quite another to go out of your way to make it happen. That “I insist” mentality is rarely found in players under 1600, though it’s also often lacking in players far above that rating too. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Ne7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The idea is simple: Black intends to swing his Knight to d6 via c8. Note that the c8-square also allows the Knight to give b6 some support, something the other route (…Ng6-h8-f7) doesn’t do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.a4 Bc8 24.Kh2 a5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Nice! Though this leaves b6 weak, it also leaves White with a serious weakness on a4. Note that b6 would have been weakened in any case after a4-a5xb6, but then White wouldn’t have that weak a-pawn. Thus, 24…a5 is clearly an excellent move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Qg2 Bg4 26.Be2 Bxe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">26…Bd7 was a logical alternative since it ties the white pieces down to the defense of a4. However, Smyslov understood that exchanging Bishops (even though white’s Bishop has that Tall-Pawn look) was the right thing to do since it highlights the weakness of both c4 and e4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Qxe2 Rad8 28.Rab1 Nc8 29.h5 Rf8 30.Rf2 Rf7 31.h6 g6 32.Rbf1 Qe7 33.Qg4 Nd6 </span>Black has achieved his goal and now holds a clear advantage—white’s kingside play doesn’t fully compensate for the weak pawns on e4, c4, and a4. The rest of the game saw Smyslov continue to outplay his opponent: <span class="bold">34.Qe6 Nxe4 35.Qxb6 f5 36.Rb2 f4 37.Qe6 fxe3 38.Rxf7 Qxf7 39.Qxe5 Nf6 40.Rb8 Ng4+ 41.Kh3 Nxe5 42.Rxd8+ Qf8 43.Rxf8+ Kxf8</span>, 0-1.</p>
