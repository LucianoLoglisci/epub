			<p class="caption3">You need to see the right move, but also see how to respond to white’s best reply.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.d4 c6 5.Bc4 Bf5 6.Bd2 Nf6 7.Nf3 e6 8.Nd5 Qd8 9.Nxf6+ gxf6 10.Bb3 Nd7 11.Qe2 Qc7 12.Nh4 Bg6 13.0–0–0 0–0–0 14.g3 Kb8 15.Ng2 Bd6 16.h4</span> - Diagram 288</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The position is actually quite sharp. At the moment we can see that black’s pawn structure is inferior to white’s, but the very doubled pawns that we label as “potentially weak” also have dynamic plusses: the g-file is opened for a black Rook and the e5- and g5-squares are inaccessible to white’s pieces.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s thematic break is …c6-c5, but at the moment he has to deal with the threat of h4-h5. The tactical 16…e5 is possible (though 17.h5 Bf5 18.Nh4 Be6 19.Bxe6 fxe6 20.dxe5 Bxe5 21.Nf3 is in white’s favor), but the most obvious replies are 16…h6 and 16…h5.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Many players would notice 16…h5, but few would play it with the express purpose of sacrificing that pawn! The knowledge needed to fully handle this position (knowing the proper pawn breaks and willfully giving up a pawn for dynamic compensation) requires someone with experience and strength.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…h5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since black’s pawn structure is made for dynamics, he needs to “up” the tempo of play by seeking ways to make his pieces as active as possible. On the other hand, White would be happy to slow down the tempo of play, make the important …c5 advance hard to achieve, and leave Black as passively placed as possible. It turns out that 16…h6 isn’t best due to “17.h5 Bh7 18.Ne3 when Black has a weak pawn at h6 and ...c6-c5 is rather hard to carry out”—Ponomariov (<span class="italic">New In Chess</span> 8, 2003). His point is that 18…c5 is met by 19.d5 when the dual threats of 20.dxe6 and 20.Ng4 (picking up the pawn on h6) are simply good for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">16…h5, though, is a different animal. Now Ng2-e3-g4 ideas are ruled out because the h-pawn controls g4 (and, of course, there is no pawn on h6 to win), and black’s …c6-c5 push is about to become a reality. Of course, Black paid a price for this: White can play 17.Nf4 and win the h-pawn (giving White another static plus in the form of an extra pawn). However, the Ng2-f4xh5 idea takes time, and Black will use that to maximize the activity of his army.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This will no doubt be very confusing for lower rated readers of this book. But there’s really only one lesson you need to absorb here: You can’t play a position properly without understanding whether your chances lie with statics or dynamics. Once you know which your (and your opponent’s!) position is dedicated to, you can insist on moves that promote it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Nf4 Bf5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Less exciting but playable is 17…e5!? 18.Nxg6 fxg6 19.dxe5 Nxe5 20.Rhe1 Ng4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Nxh5 c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is the position Black was aiming for: he’s a pawn down but the key …c6-c5 advance has been realized. Also, white’s Knight has been sidelined and needs to be defended by the Queen. The game now becomes very exciting with many tactical tricks popping up all over the place.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.g4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other moves:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.d5? works well in the position after 16…h6 17.h5 Bh7 18.Ne3 c5 19.d5, but it doesn’t hold up here (after 16…h5 17.Nf4 Bf5 18.Nxh5 c5) because the Knight is loose on h5 after 19…c4! 20.Bxc4 Ne5 threatening 21…Nxc4 and 21…Bg4.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.dxc5 Nxc5 20.Bc3 Be5 21.Bxe5 fxe5 “when Black still has a dangerous initiative”—Ponomariov (<span class="italic">New In Chess</span> 8, 2003).</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The critical choices are 19.Be3!? and the non-human 19.Ng7. Both are well worth analyzing if you have the time and inclination. However, since this isn’t a book of endless analysis (though at times it might seem like it is!), we’ll get back to the game and our all-important theme!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Rxh5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Very nice! White keeps trying to put a stopper on black’s activity (dynamics) so he can make use of his extra passed h-pawn and better overall structure (statics). Black refuses to bow, and tosses more fuel on the fire in order to keep the dynamics burning!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Having said all that, the more pedestrian 19…Bg6 was also interesting: </p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Leads to a whole new adventure</span></p></div>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>20.Bc3 cxd4 21.Bxd4 Bc5 22.Bc3 Bxh5 23.gxh5 Qf4+ 24.Kb1 Qxf2 leads to a crazy endgame where White has two Bishops, a queenside pawn majority, and the passed pawns on the h-file. Black has that central pawn clump on the f- and e-files. White seems better, but I’m not sure by how much.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>20.d5 and now Ponomariov’s recommended 20…Ne5 21.Nxf6 c4 (which he claims is fine for Black after 22.Ba4 Nd3+) actually seems to fail to the highly surprising 22.Bc3!! cxb3 23.axb3 when Black is hopelessly placed. The threat is h5 followed by Rhe1 and I can’t see how Black can deal with it in a satisfactory manner.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Instead of 20…Ne5, Black can also try 20…exd5 21.Bxd5 Nb6 when 22.Ba5 Be5! is okay for Black, and 22.Be4 Na4! creates some nasty tactical tricks against b2 and seems to solve all black’s problems. </p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 288b</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Position after 22…Na4 <br class="calibre3"/>White is forced to scramble!</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">23.Qc4 Nb6 24.Qe2 is a repetition of moves, 23.b3? runs headlong into 23…c4!, and 23.Nxf6 Be5 can’t displease Black. Most notably, 23.c3 crashes and burns after 23…Qb6 24.b3 c4! 25.Qxc4 Ba3+ 26.Kb1 (26.Kc2 Nb2) 26…Rxd2! 27.Bxg6 (27.Rxd2 Bxe4+ 28.Ka1 Qd6!! 29.Qxe4 Qxd2 wins) 27…Rb2+ 28.Ka1 Qxf2 29.bxa4 Rb4 30.Qxb4 Bxb4 31.cxb4 fxg6 and Black should win. It’s amazing what active pieces can do!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Instead of 22.Ba5 or 22.Be4, White should play 22.Bg2! and I can’t see a way for Black to equalize. Of course, pages more on 19…Bg6 can be created, so if you want to find its ultimate truth, you’ll have to burn some serious midnight oil.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.gxf5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White doesn’t bite, and continues his policy of dampening enemy counterplay. Instead, 20.gxh5 cxd4 21.Kb1 Ne5 leaves Black with extremely active pieces and gives him excellent compensation for the sacrificed Exchange.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Hopefully the philosophical Static vs. Dynamic pattern is becoming crystal clear: the side with the static edge tries to impose his static philosophy, while the guy with the dynamics does his best to impose his own brand of play on the board. The first person to cave to the other’s desires will most likely lose the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">20…Rxf5 21.Be3 cxd4 22.Bxd4 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White has managed to stem the dynamic tide and a purely static (but highly imbalanced) situation is beginning to form. Instead of Statics vs. Dynamics, we’ve ended up with Strange Statics vs. Strange Statics. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Bc5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ponomariov considered this to be an error and recommended 22…Rh8!, calling the position “unclear”. In my view, white’s Bishops and passed h-pawn give him a slight advantage, with Black still having to play very accurately before claiming equality. For example, 23.h5 Bh2? 24.h6 Rxh6 seemed okay until I realized that 25.Bxe6!! was possible: 25…fxe6 26.Qxe6 Bf4+ 27.Be3 Rxh1 28.Rxh1 Bxe3+ 29.fxe3 Qe5 30.Qxd7 a6 31.Rh8+ Ka7 32.Qd4+ Qxd4 33.exd4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A better try (after 22…Rh8 23.h5) is 23…Nc5 24.h6 (24.Kb1!?) 24…Bf4+ 25.Be3 Rg5! (25…Ne4!?) 26.Rh4 (26.Qf3) 26…Bxe3+ 27.Qxe3 Qe5 28.Qxe5+ fxe5 29.Bc4 Rg6 30.h7 Rg7 31.b4 Na4 32.Rdh1 Nb6 33.Bd3 f5 34.f3 Kc7 35.Rh6 Kd7 36.R1h4 Rf7 and Black, who is threatening …Nb6-d5-f6, is fine. However, 24.Kb1 (instead of 24.h6) seems better.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">23.Bxc5 Nxc5 24.Rxd8+ Qxd8 25.h5 </span>and the h-pawn has turned into a world-beater:<span class="bold"> 25…Nxb3+ 26.axb3 Qd5 27.Qd1 Kc7 28.h6 Qxd1+ 29.Kxd1 Rd5+ 30.Ke2 Rd8 31.b4 a6 32.c4 Rh8 33.Ke3 Rh7 34.Kf4 Rh8 35.Rh3 Rg8 36.h7 Rh8 37.Ke4 Kd6 38.Kd4 Kc6 39.Rh6 Rd8+ 40.Kc3 Rh8 41.Rh5 Kd6 42.c5+ Kc6 43.Kc4 b6 44.cxb6 Kxb6 45.b5</span>, 1-0. Ponomariov gives 45…a5 46.Kb3 f5 47.Ka4 Kc5 48.f4 f6 (48…Kd4 49.b6 Ke3 50.b7 Kxf4 51.Rh4+ Kg3 52.Rc4) 49.Rh6 e5 50.b6 exf4 51.b7 f3 52.Rxf6 Kd5 53.Rxf5+ Kc6 54.Rxf3 and it’s over.</p>
