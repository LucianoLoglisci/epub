			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Space is created by the expansion of pawns. If you think of a line of pawns as a fence, you will easily understand the concept of the territory behind your “fence” being yours.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>An advantage in space is one of <span class="italic">the</span> most highly prized imbalances among modern grandmasters.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A huge advantage in space takes away many enemy options. In fact, if it isn’t dealt with properly, the side with less space can easily end up with a passive, cheerless position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you possess an advantage in space, don’t forget about the other imbalances. For example, playing for a superior minor piece can be a useful complement to your territorial gains.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It’s usually a good idea for the side with more space to avoid unnecessary exchanges. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, there are four ways to fight against an enemy space advantage:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Exchange pieces so your limited territory is no longer uncomfortable.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Use pawn breaks to crack his seemingly indestructible pawn-façade.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Try and prove that your opponent’s gain in space has left weak squares in its wake.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Treat a space-gaining enemy pawn center as a target!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Pawns protect squares. This seems obvious, but it’s something that needs to be pondered and appreciated since many players forget that as pawns advance, the potential amount of squares they control diminishes. This means that as a player pushes his pawns and gains more and more space with them, he is also potentially leaving weakened squares in their wake.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Of course, pushing your pawns and creating squares that might prove weak later in the game is unavoidable. The key here is awareness—as long as you know the downside of every pawn advance, you’ll be able to better judge whether or not such a square will really to be a problem as the game progresses.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Aside from trying to shatter the center and feast on its tattered remains, one can also force the center to advance and make use of the newly weakened squares these advances often create. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, you don’t want to wait around while the opponent’s center grows more and more stable. You need to attack it with as much energy as possible.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>When facing a serious spatial disadvantage, you must demand counterplay by creating space in another sector of the board, finding a way to make soothing exchanges (which creates more room on your side of the board), proving that your opponent’s spatial gains have left serious weaknesses in its wake, and/or by using pawn breaks to smash open lines and give your pieces the freedom to fight back!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In a closed position, pawn breaks are necessary to open lines for attack and to open files so the Rooks can join in the action.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In closed positions, the side with more pawn breaks is the side with the ability to call the shots.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Cat and Mouse is a strategy where your opponent is helpless. In such situations, barring a forced win, it’s often good to “Do in twenty what you could do in two.” In other words, take your time and let your opponent enjoy the full bouquet of his position’s misery.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If the center is closed, play has to be found on the wings. In such positions, you usually want to play on the side where you have more space (of course, there <span class="italic">are</span> exceptions—don’t treat any rule as gospel). Once you determine which side that is, you will try and create weaknesses in the enemy camp, use pawn advances to gain even more territory in your chosen sector, and pawn breaks to crack open files for the Rooks so you can use them to penetrate into the hostile position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In general, your space lies where your pawn chain points—to add to your space (and rip open files) in that area, you need to push the pawn that’s next to your lead pawn.</p>
