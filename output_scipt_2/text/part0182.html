			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is from a “postal” game on Chessworld.net between <a id="x0404it--2150--and-RR--unrated---2008"/>0404it (2150) and RR (unrated), 2008. Both players could use more exciting names, but the position they reached is quite an instructive one. White has more space in every sector of the board. White has two active Bishops. White has an attack against the enemy King. White controls the center. White has the better pawn structure (e6 is weak). Black’s Knights play a purely defensive role. These facts tell us that White enjoys an overwhelming position.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The answer is very straightforward and not only entombs the Knight, but also attacks the King. A 1200 might miss the entombed horse, but going after black’s King with g6 would certainly prove attractive.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mr. 0404it finishes the game in exemplary fashion:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.g6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White had the choice of several good moves, but this makes (by far!) the nicest impression. If you played this to specifically entomb black’s h8-Knight, then give yourself a pat on the back!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…h6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Playing such a move must feel similar to slicing one’s own wrists with a dull blade. However, Black couldn’t have been very excited by lines like 1…Bf6 (1…Rf8 is better, but 2.gxh7+ Kxh7 3.Rg1 Rf7 4.Rcf1 Rdf8 5.Bd3 gives White a devastating attack) 2.gxh7+ Kxh7 3.e5 Be7 4.Bd3+ Kg8 5.h6 (threatening 6.h7 mate) 5…g6 6.Bxg6 and it’s all over.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">What’s that thing on h8?</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 1…h6 we have the honor of being witness to a classic Knight entombment and the coining of a new chess term. From this moment on, an entombed horse on h1, a1, a8, or h8 will be known as a <span class="italic">Vestigial Knight</span>—it looks like a Knight, it smells like a Knight, but it doesn’t move or twitch (even if you poke it) or serve any real function. In effect this means that White is a piece up and can win a middlegame (since he has a larger army to make use of) or an endgame with ease.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Ne1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A lovely move that shows white’s class. Seeing that Black is completely helpless, White realizes he’s in no hurry to lower the boom and first seeks to improve the position of his lamest piece—the c2-Knight. The concept of calmly bringing all your pieces to their best squares is a very important one, and is often overlooked by the amateur. The following quote by Grandmaster Jesse Kraai (during a lecture in 2008) pushes the point home: “Bad players like to play with their ‘pretty’ pieces. It is the mark of good players that they won’t go on an adventure before they solve the problem of their bad pieces.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Rf8 3.Nd3 Rxf1+ 4.Rxf1 Bd6 5.Nc5 Bxc5 6.dxc5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s advantage has grown since he now has two Bishops vs. a Knight and a thing on h8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Qe7 7.Bf4</span>, 1-0. There’s nothing to be done about 8.Bxc7 when e6 falls and the remnants of black’s position crashes to the ground.</p>
