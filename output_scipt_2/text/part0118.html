			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>This chapter is designed to make you aware of the eternal war between a “firm foundation” (positional/static factors) and a “firm fist” (dynamics).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Battle of statics vs. dynamics—the fight between one side’s long-term plusses and the other’s short-term, use-them-now-or-die, chances (active pieces, attacking possibilities based on a vulnerable enemy King, or swing-from-the-fence tactics that seemingly appear from nowhere but are actually a logical expression of basic combinative rules).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Dynamics can beat statics and statics can beat dynamics. It’s up to the player to judge which is of more value in the particular position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>One of the nice things about being on the side of statics is that they tend to last a long, long time while dynamics are like a flare that burns bright for a few moments before fading into oblivion. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Conversely, dynamics can sometimes light up the board when you thought you had a static lock!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>It’s critically important to know if the position demands static or dynamic play from you. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>At times there might be a choice about which direction (Statics or Dynamics) you’ll take, but more often than not, the writing is on the wall and there’s only one correct decision.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A dynamic plus is often cashed in for a longer lasting static plus.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The transformation of one kind of imbalance (static or dynamic) into another kind of imbalance (dynamic or static) is very common.</p>
