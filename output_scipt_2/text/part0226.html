			<p class="caption3">What’s going on?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.f4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.Bb5 Nf6 5.Bxc6 dxc6 6.d3 Be7 7.0–0 0–0 8.a4 a5 9.Na3 Qc7 10.Qe1 b6 11.Bd2 Nd7 12.Nc4 Ba6 13.b3 Bxc4 14.bxc4 e5 15.f5 Rfd8 16.g4 Nb8 17.Qg3 Na6 18.Nxe5 Bd6 19.Bf4 f6 20.d4 cxd4 21.Nd3 Nc5? 22.Rae1 Bxf4 23.Rxf4 Nxd3 24.cxd3 b5 25.axb5 cxb5 26.cxb5 a4 27.g5 Kh8 28.e5 a3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">28…fxg5 29.Qxg5 a3 was correct. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.b6 Qxb6 30.exf6 gxf6 31.Re7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I don’t remember why I allowed this to occur, but here I woke up and realized that I was toast. And since I was sure that I would lose (most likely in some grisly fashion), I descended into the self-defeating world of “I can’t” (as in “I can’t survive this!”).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31…Rg8 32.g6??</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And here Larry succumbed to an “I have to” moment (as in “I <span class="italic">have</span> to win after this!”). If he had thought about the position for a moment, he’d have seen that 32.Rh4 wins on the spot (32…Rg7 33.Rxg7 Kxg7 34.gxf6+ mates by force).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">32…Rg7 33.Rfe4 Qd8?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">More defeatism—“I’m doomed, I’m an idiot, I can’t save myself” repeated over and over in my head. If I had shut off the pity spigot, I might have noticed that 33…Qb1+ saves me: 34.Kg2 (34.Re1 a2 35.Rxg7 Kxg7 36.Qc7+ Kh6 37.Qf4+ with a draw, and not 37.Qxh7+?? Kg5 when Black wins) 34…Qa2+! 35.Kf3 Qg8 and the Queen manages to successfully defend its mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">34.Rxg7?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Larry was having his own problems and he kept playing the “This <span class="italic">has</span> to win” move instead of settling down and proving it was as crushing as it seemed. If he had done this, then he would surely have changed his mind and played 34.Qe1!, which wins easily.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Unfortunately, he played 34.Rxg7 with such authority (as if saying, “You’re dead meat, sucker!”) that I completely bought into his delusion. There was no doubt in my mind that the end was near.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">34…Kxg7 35.Rh4 a2 36.Rxh7+</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black Resigns! I doubt that this is the move you decided on, but it was indeed my (completely insane) choice during the game. Things <span class="italic">do</span> look scary, but “resigns” seems a rather extreme “solution” to black’s problem!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Of course, you’ve been alerted to the fact that something’s up, but it’s still quite difficult. Part of that difficulty lies with the fact that players tend to get a bit freaked out when their King is being kicked about.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are only two choices for Black in diagram 176, but, as you’ve already seen, I found a third! I actually took quite a long think here. The first thing I did was reject 36…Kf8 since it gives White the chance to transpose into the same position reached after 36…Kg8 (36…Kf8 37.Rh8+ Kg7 38.Rxd8) while also offering him the extra possibility of 37.g7+ Kg8 38.Rh8+ Kf7, which seemed downright terrifying. As it turns out, the terror was in my head, not on the board: 39.Rf8+ (39.Rxd8 a1=Q+ 40.Kg2 Qa2+ 41.Kf3 Rxd8 42.Qc7+ Ke8 43.Qc6+ is also drawn) 39…Qxf8 40.gxf8=Q+ Kxf8 41.Qd6+ Kg7 42.Qe7+ Kg8, draw.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since White can force the key line after both 36…Kf8 and 36…Kg8, I concentrated on that particular variation: 36…Kg8 37.Rh8+ Kg7 38.Rxd8 a1=Q+ 39.Kg2 Ra2+ (I didn’t trust 39…Qb2+, but it turns out to be fine: 40.Kh3 Rxd8 41.Qc7+ Kh6 42.Qxd8 Qf2, =) 40.Kh3 Qf1+ 41.Kh4 </p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Pondering this position, I realized it was the end of the road. “I’m doomed, and I’ve been doomed for a long time. Time to put it to rest.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I reached out (after 36.Rxh7+), said, “I give up” and shook Christiansen’s hand. He looked at me in shock and said, “I was about to offer you a draw! It’s a perpetual check or stalemate!” He then played out the moves that led to the expected final position (previous diagram that occurred after 41.Kh4) and slammed down 41…Rxh2+!! 42.Qxh2 (42.Kg4 loses) 42…Qf4+! 43.Kh3 (43.Qxf4 stalemate) 43…Qg4+ 44.Kxg4 stalemate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Fortunately, there were no sharp objects within reach at that moment, and this allowed me to live to fight another day. And, as is so often the case, it proved to be a very important lesson. I realized that my negative frame of mind made it impossible for me to see what was really going on, and I understood that uncontrolled emotion should only be released <span class="italic">after</span> the game, not during. As a result, I worked hard to eradicate “I can’t” from my psyche—in fact, I traded negatives like “I can’t” and “I’m doomed” and “It’s hopeless” to “There’s always a defense!” The belief that one can fight to the bitter end and place serious difficulties in front of your opponent even in the worst of situations served me very well as my career progressed. And, when an opponent would play a dodgy move, I firmly embraced the mentality that it was “Rubbish” or it “Had to be punished.”</p>
