			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Congratulations. You’ve almost completed a long journey into the exploration, understanding, and use of positional concepts based, of course, on imbalances. To regiment your studies throughout the book, I found it necessary to present the information in the form of individual imbalances. However, the vast majority of games are fought on a battleground composed of many imbalances that, more often than not, are at odds with each other.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The following tests are designed to give you insight into how much you’ve learned <span class="italic">and</span> to serve as extra instruction. If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
