			<p class="caption3">Is 14.Rxc6 a good idea?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 a6 5.c5 Nbd7 6.Bf4 Nh5 7.e3 g6 8.h4 Nxf4 9.exf4 Bg7 10.Qd2 b6 11.cxb6 Qxb6 12.Rc1 0–0 13.Na4 Qa7</span> - Diagram 165</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Things are going quite well for White, who has chances of a kingside attack with h4-h5, a bind on the e5-square (Thanks to the doubling of the f-pawns. If white’s pawn still stood on the “healthy” e3-square then Black could seek counterplay by …e7-e5.), more space in every sector of the board, and long-term pressure against the weak pawns on a6 and c6. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Does Black have anything? He has two Bishops, but at the moment white’s Knights are dominating them. Black’s only other plus is white’s central King, but if the center can’t be opened then that might not amount to anything since the black pieces won’t be able to reach white’s monarch on e1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The question was whether chopping on c6 was a good idea. In this case it gives Black far more play than he deserves after 14.Rxc6?! Nf6 15.Nc5 Ne4 16.Nxe4 dxe4 17.Ne5 Rd8 18.Bc4 e6. Why give your opponent tons of counterplay (White might still be a bit better, but certainly no more than that) when there is more to gain by keeping a solid grip on the position?</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: White has a lot of advantages, so why give Black counterplay when you’re in control of the game? I do appreciate greed, though, and fully understand why 14.Rxc6 would be given a go. However, I suspect that more experienced players would hold off.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game White wisely avoided the capture on c6 and instead pushed his own agenda by <span class="bold">14.h5 a5 15.hxg6 fxg6</span> (15…hxg6 was preferable, but still much better for White) when we get yet another chance to chop on c6.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">In the game White again avoided 16.Rxc6 with the tightening move 16.g3. This was a good practical decision and led to eventual victory. However now, thanks to the newly created weaknesses in black’s King position, the circumstances have changed and taking the pawn was best: <span class="bold">16.Rxc6! Nf6 17.Nc5 Ne4</span> (17…Bd7 18.Ra6) <span class="bold">18.Nxe4 dxe4 19.Bc4+ e6 20.Ng5</span> with an overwhelming position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It should be clear that grabbing a material plus isn’t always a no-brainer. In fact, if it gives your opponent too many positive imbalances then you should usually beat back the greed-impulse and look for a more controlled way to handle the position. On the other hand, if you were already in trouble, sacrificing material for counterplay (in the case of our last example, 14.Rxc6 allowed 14…Nf6 followed by 15…Ne4 when black’s formerly passive pieces spring to life) is something you should get used to doing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Interestingly, the example in diagram 165 showed many psychological and practical nuances that are related to the giving and taking of material: We saw (on move 14) the defender offer a pawn for counterplay (demonstrating that he’s transcended the “I can’t ever give away my stuff” syndrome), we saw White wisely refuse it (not allowing the opponent to gain undeserved activity), then (on move 16) we saw White refuse to take a pawn that could have safely been taken. However, this decision is a very human one—when you have a positional lock, why go on tactical adventures (which might easily lead to an oversight) when you can continue to safely “massage” your opponent until he finally cracks and dies?</p>
