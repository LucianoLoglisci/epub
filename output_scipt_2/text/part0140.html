			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn can be a static powerhouse and/or a dynamic game winner. Thus understanding it will also improve your understanding of statics and dynamics.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn discourse is the ideal training ground for the concept of blockade.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A pawn majority’s ultimate goal is the creation of a passed pawn—understanding passed pawns vastly increases your understanding of pawn majorities.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn, even a protected passed pawn, can often turn out to be a serious disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn usually shines brightest in King and pawn endgames and Queen endgames since, in this case, the lone enemy Queen can’t maintain a blockade on its own.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The ideal plan for a player with an advanced passed pawn is to exchange all the minor pieces, leaving both sides with a Queen and Rook(s) vs. Queen and Rook(s). This makes the blockade of the passer uncomfortable since Queens and Rooks are not ideal blockaders. Note that the Queens should usually be retained since that piece’s power makes the defending King’s participation in the defense rather risky.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>There are three kinds of useless passed pawns:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>There is a life and death struggle going on and the pawn has absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A successful blockade relegates it to useless status.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>It turns out to be more weakness than strength. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>When a passed pawn exists on the board, a blockade of the pawn is often of critical importance for both sides. Will the defender manage to create a successful blockade? Will the side with the passer managed to prevent it? Games are won and lost on these things, so enter such blockade battles as if your chess life depended on the outcome!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Blockading an enemy passed pawn is extremely important, but I left out one small piece of the puzzle: If you don’t have some form of active play, then you are doomed to a miserable defensive task that you probably won’t recover from.</p>
