			<p class="caption4">This is a position from the Sveshnikov Sicilian. Both sides played the opening logically and White has emerged with a small edge. Both sides have active pieces. Black has some pressure against b3 and would love to get his central pawn majority moving by …d6-d5. Though White has definite designs against a5, his immediate goal is to stop black’s dream of …d6-d5 so that the d-pawn will remain a static weakness instead of a dynamic plus. Once he does that, he can pile up on d6 and place Black permanently on the defensive. What moves best strive to achieve these two goals (i.e., to stop …d5 and hit d6)?</p>

			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I feel that a 1400 should be able to find at least one of the moves that directly relate to the stated goals. And this is really the whole point of the book—once you learn to read the imbalances, and once you create logical goals that are based on them, then you can find high caliber moves that cater to the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White has tried 21.Qa1, 21.Nxf5, 21.Qd2, and 21.Ra2 here. Let’s look at each:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>21.Qa1 creates an immediate threat against a5, but has nothing to do with the question that was posed since it actually takes all the pressure off of both d6 and d5. As a result, Black was able to get his d-pawn moving: 21…d5 22.Rd1 Bd7 23.Rxa5 dxc4 24.Ra7 cxb3 25.Rdxd7? (25.Raxd7 Qe8, =) 25…b2 26.Qb1 Qb6 27.Rxe7?? (27.h3) 27…Qg6 28.Qxg6 hxg6 29.Rxg7 b1=Q+ 30.Nf1 g5 31.Rxg5 Rf5 32.Rg4 Qb2 33.Ne3 Qxf2+, 0-1, <a id="M.-Santo-Roman---J.-Blaskowski---U-18--Suedlohn-1981"/>M. Santo Roman - J. Blaskowski, (U 18) Suedlohn 1981. That’s what happens when you let your opponent get undeserved activity.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>21.Nxf5 isn’t bad, but it has little to do with the stated goals. In fact, it actually weakens white’s control over the d5-square. The game <a id="S.-Karjakin---A.-Khalifman--Amsterdam-2007"/>S. Karjakin - A. Khalifman, Amsterdam 2007 ended quickly after 21…Rxf5 22.Bd3 Rf6 23.Bc2 Qb6 24.b4 axb4 25.Rxb4 Qc7 26.Qd3, 1/2-1/2. White doesn’t have anything after 26…g6.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>21.Qd2 addresses the question and makes a lot of sense, so you get full credit for making the question and answer match. However, it hasn’t proven to be particularly effective: 21…Be4 22.Nd5 (22.Rd1 d5) 22…Bxd5 23.Bxd5 Nxd5 24.Qxd5 Qc7 25.Qxa5 Qxa5 26.Rxa5 Rxb3 27.Rd5 Rf6 28.Rfd1 Rxc3 29.Rxe5 h6, 1/2-1/2, <a id="A.-Sokolov---I.-Nataf--France-2007"/>A. Sokolov - I. Nataf, France 2007.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>21.Ra2, intending Rd2, is the most interesting move and fits very nicely with the goals I laid out. Though White only has a small plus, he put on a great performance and showed how ironclad adherence to an imbalance-based plan can even drag down a chess superstar:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Ra2! Be4 22.Rd2 Rb6 23.Re1 Qb8 24.Qa1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Having tied Black down to d6, he now adds to his opponent’s problems by hitting a5. But the real point is to intensify the heat on d6 by Red1 and Qa3. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Qc7 25.Red1 h6 26.h3 Bb7 27.Qa3 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Logic in motion—White’s pieces form a beautiful picture of a team effort. The rest of the game is a lovely display by Hungary’s greatest player: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">27…Rd8 28.Be6 Qxc3 29.Rxd6 Rbxd6 30.Rxd6 Qe1+ 31.Kh2 Re8 32.Rd7 Nc6 33.Bf7 Ra8 34.Rxb7 Qxf2 35.Bd5 Rc8 36.Rf7 Qxe3 37.Bxc6</span>, 1-0.</p>
