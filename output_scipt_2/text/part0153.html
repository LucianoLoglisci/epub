			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The imbalances are a critical tool for a proper understanding of any and all opening systems.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that suit your style/temperament—just because the world’s best players use it doesn’t mean that it’s right for you!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that suit both your schedule and memory.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that cater to your chess strengths—i.e., if you play closed positions really well, go for systems that tend to lock up the center. If you are a strong positional player but can’t always “keep up” in sharp tactical situations, pick lines that avoid chaos. If tactics is what you’re all about, make sure your opening choices are conducive to that particular talent.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Choose openings that make you happy—this might sound a tad strange, but if the positions you achieve from your openings don’t make you feel excited, happy, or at the very least, deeply satisfied, then why in the world are you using those systems?</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Don’t choose openings based on the opinion of others, on chess squiggles like += and =, or on computer assessments. Even if a position is thought to be mildly better for the other side, that doesn’t mean it’s not fully playable. Often a player’s affinity for a particular position is far more important than its reputation. Basically, if you like it, then play it.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you wish to create a temporary “learning” repertoire based on facing and fixing your weaknesses, then you can consider these three things:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Choose openings that <span class="italic">don’t</span> suit your style/temperament!</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Choose openings that cater to your chess <span class="italic">weaknesses</span>!</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Choose openings that freak you out and leave you feeling vulnerable and insecure!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Whether your opening is dynamic or static, closed or open, you need to fully understand the interplay of imbalances that your opening offers.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>An opening battle between two theoretically astute players ultimately boils down to a philosophical difference of opinion. But if you don’t know the philosophy (imbalances and general ideas) behind your opening lines, then all you’re left with is random moves.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>You always need to know what your opening is giving to you, and what it’s giving to your opponent.</p>
