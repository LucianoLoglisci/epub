			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">These problems will test your ability to see beyond chess illusion, and beyond fear. They will also make it clear that we all suffer from the illness of “I can’t” and “I must.” You are most certainly not alone!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button)..</p>
