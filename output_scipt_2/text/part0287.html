			<p class="caption">White has just played Nh4, a move tried in a few games. Why would he play such a move?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0–0 6.h3 e5 7.d5 Na6 8.Bg5 Qe8 9.g4 Nd7 10.Rg1 Kh8 11.Qd2 Ndc5 12.Nh4!?</span> - Diagram 421</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To understand this move, you need to understand black’s usual plans in this kind of position—the answer lies in the pawn structure. Since the center is locked, and since the Rooks aren’t doing anything, Black needs to employ pawn breaks to open files for his Rooks and give himself some space for his pieces. The most common King’s Indian pawn break is …f7-f5 (gaining kingside space and instantly activating his Rook on f8), while …c7-c6 (trying to open some queenside lines) is also a thematic try in quite a few KID systems. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Armed with the knowledge that …f7-f5 is black’s main idea, white’s 12.Nh4 makes perfect sense: he’s clamping down on f5 and preventing that particular black plan—12…f5? 13.gxf5 gxf5 14.Bh6 (Even 14.exf5 Bxf5 15.Nxf5 Rxf5 16.Be3 is nice for White, since the light-squares inside black’s camp are weak due to the absence of his light-squared Bishop) 14…Rg8 15.Bxg7+ Rxg7 16.Rxg7 Kxg7 17.Qg5+ Kh8 18.exf5 is obviously not very attractive for Black!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This problem is all about closed positions and the need for pawn breaks when such structures occur. Once you realize that …f5 is black’s main idea, Nh4 makes perfect sense (whether it’s good or not is another matter).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, after 12.Nh4 Black shouldn’t panic. Moves such as 12…c6, 12…Na4, and 12…Bd7 have all been tried with reasonable results—black’s idea in all these cases is to seek play on the queenside while ignoring the h4-Knight, which is effectively stranded and unable to help when a battle erupts on the other side of the board.</p>
