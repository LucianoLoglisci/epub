			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once we learn how to move the pieces, the next stage of our chess development is to get stomped by having our chessmen taken one after the other, falling for mates, and various other horrific demises that teach us that the chessboard is a very unforgiving environment. Naturally, the pain of hanging your Queen or falling for tricks creates the desire to stop the bloodbath and protect your army! And with that initial scarring comes a host of psychological chess disorders which ultimately need to be identified and addressed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s a basic example of two players in the 1100 to 1200 rating range and the travails they go through. It was my student’s (Teradeath) second lesson. In our first I pointed out that he reacts far too much to his opponent’s innuendos. In this game he tried very hard to recognize and fix that failing.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White is the first to crack! He noticed the possibility of …Ng4 and became so worried about a horse stampede around his King that he wasted a tempo to prevent it. Instead he should have gone about his business with 6.Nf3 when 6…Ng4 7.0-0 takes care of the problem while doing something positive that he wanted to do anyway (castling).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I should add that White was probably worried about 6.Nf3 Ng4 7.0-0 Nxf2 8.Rxf2 Bxf2+ 9.Kxf2, but even though point-count will tell us that material is even, the fact is that White is the one who would be happy with that exchange. In the middlegame, two minor pieces usually prove stronger than a Rook and pawn since the Rook won’t be doing much until a file opens, and since the extra pawn most likely won’t make a huge impact on the early stages of the game. Keep in mind that a Rook is nice, but two minor pieces is a gang!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Bb6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Not a terrible move, but quite unnecessary. Is this really the best Black has? Doesn’t he have more important things to do with his move? What move would you play if White had no threat (which he doesn’t)? The answer is simple: 6…0-0! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Always ask, “What move would I like to play?” Then do your best to make it work.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Nf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now e5 is threatened and that one tiny threat grabs black’s attention and makes him do something he probably didn’t want to do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…d4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, if Black had castled then he could defend e5 with the comfortable 7…Re8. However, since that’s not possible, the simplest and most positive way to guard the pawn was 7…Qe7 (or 7…Qd6), not fearing 8.Ba3 Bc5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What’s wrong with 7…d4? The first thing is psychological: Black felt compelled to do something he didn’t particularly wish to do. Other than that, the move opens the h1-a8 diagonal for white’s light-squared Bishop, gives white’s Knights access to the c4-square, and blocks black’s dark-squared Bishop.</p>
			<p class="float-title">remember</p>
			<p class="float-text">Before playing a move, always ask, “What wonderful thing does this do for my position?” If you can’t answer that question, or if the answer has more negatives than positives, one is left wondering how you can justify playing it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.c3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not horrible, but White isn’t aware of the perks this move and the subsequent capture on d4 will give his opponent. This will be discussed over the next few moves.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…0–0 9.cxd4 Nxd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Quite reasonable, though Black wasn’t aware that 9…exd4 opened the e-file for his Rook (this would allow him to generate pressure against e2 after …Re8). Amateurs often have serious trouble getting their Rooks into the game during its early stages. However, once they realize that clearing a pawn off a file gives their Rook(s) a highway to travel on, life becomes much easier. This subject is deeply explored in Part Three, Rooks. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Nxd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Wisely avoiding 10.Nxe5? Re8, when White has opened lines to his own King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…Bxd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Still not grasping the significance of a pawn capture on d4. I would prefer 10…exd4 11.Nd2 c6 12.0–0 Re8 when e2 is a permanent target. It’s important to get all your pieces into play, and to create long term targets whenever possible!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.Qc2 c5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Before looking at the game together, my student gave me a copy of it with full annotations. I was proud of him when I saw the note to his 11th move: “Is this where I cracked? At the time I was thinking, ‘I have to!’ as in ‘I have to protect my c-pawn in case I need to move my Queen.’”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Looking at it now, I see that 11…c5 blocks my Bishop in case I want to get it out of the way, and I can’t move my b-pawn because it’s pinned. I should have considered just 11…c6, which protects my c-pawn from white’s Queen and my b-pawn from white’s g2-Bishop.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We had discussed “I can’t” in our first lesson, so his noticing it so quickly was a very positive thing (the first step to slowly but surely ironing the problem out is to recognize it). And, of course, he’s right on about 11…c6, though White would be okay with 12.Nc3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.0–0 Re8 13.Nd2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">13.Nc3 was better, when black’s dark-squared Bishop is sort of alone on d4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Be6 14.e3? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White didn’t notice that this gave up the d-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">14…Bxb2 15.Qxb2 Qxd3 16.Rad1 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">A big moment; how will Black react to the facedown by the d1-Rook?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…Qg6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Sending the Queen off to the side. This isn’t terrible, but it wasn’t played for the right reason (his reason was, “Run for your life!”). I would have been much happier if he looked that Rook in the eye and played 16…Rad8!, increasing the tension and asking who is facing down whom. After 16…Rad8 17.Ne4 (Not best, but it will illustrate why Black didn’t have to fear the enemy Rook. 17.Bxb7 Bxh3 18.Ne4 was better, though Black has a plus after 18…Qxd1) 17…Qxd1 (It takes a long time for players to get used to giving up their Queen for material equivalents, though the fact is that two Rooks are usually better than a Queen) 18.Nxf6+ gxf6 19.Rxd1 Rxd1+ 20.Kh2 Red8 and white’s doomed because of the threat of a Rook coming to d2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other good choices were 16...Qa6 and 16...Qb5, holding onto his material plus, but the psychologically powerful 16…Rad8 is a move that would put a huge grin on the face of any teacher.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Bxb7 Rad8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Quite good, but a “soft and/or quick move” in that Black hadn’t really taken stock of what was going on in the position (as demonstrated by his 18th). 17…Rab8 18.Bg2 c4 getting rid of the weak c-pawn and creating a weakness on b3 would be reasonable—the idea of ridding yourself of weaknesses while simultaneously giving weak points to your opponent is very important but somewhat advanced.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Bg2 Rb8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black notices the idea of …c5-c4 and rushes to make use of it. Naturally, he needed to see it a move before by asking (on move 17), “The Rook is going to move, but where would it perform a useful function? I don’t want to just move it somewhere, I want to move it where it works with the other pieces and serves a particular purpose.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As it turns out, 16…Qg6 combined with 17…Rad8 was okay if seen in the context of building kingside pressure by 18…Qh5! Then we can see that white’s 6.h3 weakened his kingside structure and Black is logically trying to take advantage of it. Here are some illustrative lines that might occur after 18…Qh5. White can try 19.Kh2 or 19.g4: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.Kh2 e4 (19…Ng4+ 20.Kg1 Nf6 21.Kh2 Ng4+ is a draw) 20.Rc1 Ng4+ (moves such as 20…Bg4!?, 20…Rd5!?, and 20…Rd3!? also deserve consideration) 21.Kg1 Ne5 22.Kh2?? (White needed to give up the Exchange by 22.Rxc5! Nf3+ 23.Bxf3 Qxc5 24.Nxe4 with compensation, though White would still have some problems to solve after 24…Qb4) 22…Rxd2! 23.Qxd2 Nf3+ 24.Kh1 (24.Bxf3 Qxh3+ 25.Kg1 exf3 mates) 24…Bxh3 mates. </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>19.g4 Qg6 (Mission accomplished! White’s kingside is now weaker than ever.) 20.Nc4 Rxd1 21.Rxd1 Bxc4 22.bxc4 h5 23.gxh5 Qxh5 and the vulnerability of white’s King will make it hard for him to generate serious winning chances: 24.Rd2 Qf5!? (24…e4!?) 25.Rd6?! (25.Qb5 is better, when 25…Rc8 26.Qb7 Qe6 27.Rb2 e4 28.Rb5 Kh7 seems okay) 25…Ne4 26.Rd1 Ng5 27.Qb5 Re6 shows how quickly storm clouds can appear over white’s kingside.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">All this analysis is very complicated and advanced, but it’s worth checking out so you can get a feel how a ruptured kingside pawn structure can easily give the other side counterplay.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Nf3? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s important to recognize pawn weaknesses and, once you do, to bring your pieces to bear on them. Thus 19.Qa3 (hitting a7 and c5) and 19.Rc1 (hitting c5 and stopping …c5-c4) should be natural choices that are fully in line with the imbalances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After 19.Nf3, Black blundered with 19…Bd5?? (allowing 20.Nh4, winning significant amounts of material). Instead, 19…e4 would have granted him the kind of kingside counterplay we saw in the note to black’s 18th move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I can hear many of you saying, “I’m much stronger than those guys! I don’t make mistakes like that!” Really? You don’t? I beg to differ—everyone under master suffers from the same aberrations as these two players do, though in an increasingly more subtle form as one rises up the rating ladder.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game we just looked at shows how we’re buffeted about the board by the winds of fear (<span class="italic">soft moves</span> also played a part). We’ve explored this fear of threats in the previous chapters, Mental Breakdown and Macho Chess, and though we’ll continue to see examples of this disease here, it’s time to take a serious look at three other psychological disorders:</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-78" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-5"/>Lack of Patience</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When you’re doing well, it’s important to not allow undeserved counterplay. If your advantage is dynamic, then rushing in and clubbing him over and over is often the right thing to do. But if the advantageous imbalances are static (space, superior minor piece, better pawn structure, etc.) then a little patience can go a long way towards making your opponent helpless, which in turn lets you reel in the point without unnecessary adventures.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At times, the decision is about your playing strength and/or comfort level—what can you handle, and what is too hot to handle?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White has outplayed her powerful opponent (an international master!) and has an obvious advantage—the massive center and the extra space that it gives place Black in serious trouble (an advantage in space is fully explored in Part Seven). However, there’s a “tiny” problem with the f4- and c4-pawns and with big centers in general: the player with the large center has to defend it—if he can make it indestructible, then the center rules. If the center proves unsustainable, then it will crumble and the opponent’s strategy will win out. With this “guard the center” rule in mind, White should look for something that takes care of both vulnerable (c4 and f4) pawns.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since 26.Ng1 fails to 26…Nb6 (26…f6 first might be even better), White is left with three reasonable moves:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">26.Ne2 gums up the white army. Black escapes his difficulties with 26…f6 27.e6 Nb6 28.Rc1 Nxd5! 29.cxd5 Rxd5 30.Nc3 Nxf4+ 31.Kh1 Rd6 32.Ne4 Rdxe6 33.Nxc5 R6e7, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">26.Nd2 defends both weak spots at the same time and appears to leave White with a clear advantage. Perhaps that’s true, but it’s not so easy to prove. Since the center is too strong to leave alone (Black either breaks it down or is broken himself), he has to try 26…g5 27.fxg5 Rxe5 and we reach a surprisingly complicated position. A quick glance at a couple lines will show us that any ultimate truth is very hard for a mere mortal to discover: 28.Nf3 (28.Rxe5 Nxe5 29.Rf5 Re8 30.d6 Ng7 31.Rf2 Rd8 33.Nce4 b6, =, or 30.Kh3 Kg7 31.Nb5 Nd3 when Black is still fighting tooth and nail) 28…Rf5 29.Kh3 f6 (29…Rf4 30.Ne4) 30.Ne4 Re8 31.Nfd2 Rxf1 32.Rxf1 fxg5 33.Kg4 Ng7 34.Rb1 (34. Kxg5 b5 35.cxb5 Re5+ gives counterplay) 34…b6 35.Kxg5 Re5+ 36.Kf4 Rf5+ 37.Ke3 Rh5 and it’s still a bit of a mess, though White will never be in any danger.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In deciding which move to play, Pam didn’t trust the contortionist 26.Ne2 and, since she missed the threat of …Nb6 altogether, she didn’t see any reason to play 26.Nd2. Had she noticed that, I suspect 26.Nd2 would have been chosen. It looks good, it looks safe, and it would have taken a very strong player to see that Black actually has ways to rock the boat in that line.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As it turns out, she played a third possibility, <span class="bold">26.Ng5</span>, and this appears to be the best move. Nevertheless, she didn’t see <span class="italic">why</span> it was the best move and, as a result, she would probably have done better with 26.Nd2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Nb6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">26…h6 27.Nge4 Nb6 and now 28.Nd2 keeps a safe lock on everything while 28.Nxc5 Nxc4 29.Nxb7 Rb8 30.Nc5 Rec8 31.N5e4 looks strong.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Nge4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Shocked by the fact that she missed the obvious 26…Nb6, she loses her confidence and begins a spiral into oblivion. After the correct 27.f5! Nxc4 28.fxg6 fxg6 29.Nf7 Rb8 30.d6 Black would be toast.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s still doing very well, but she didn’t anticipate these complications and soon drowns under them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.N5e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">29.N3e4 Red8 30.d6 offered White a safe plus, but White was still off-kilter about the fact that black’s pieces were somehow becoming quite active!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Rushing headfirst into even more complications. She should have put the brakes on the madness with the solid 30.Ng3 Nf6! (30…Nxg3 31.hxg3 Nd2 32.Rf2 is just good for White) 31.Kh1 (Played to avoid a Knight fork on f3 in the critical line. White must, of course, avoid 31.exf6? Ne3+) 31…Ng4 33.d6 Ngxe5 34.fxe5 Rxe5 35.Rxe5 Nxe5 36.Re1 Nc6 37.Nb5 and Black will be struggling for a long time.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">She could have put her fears to rest by 34.Nf6+ Nxf6 35.exf6 Rc2+ 36.Kh1 Kf7 37.Rc1 Rxc1 38.Rxc1 b6 39.Re1! when only White can harbor dreams of victory. Sadly, the world was spinning and clear thought was something to be experienced in a later game. I’ve been there many times and I’m sure you have too!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">34…Nxf4+ 35.Rxf4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Simply 35.Kh1 was quite safe.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">35…Rxc1 36.Nf6+ Kf7</span>, 0-1. A complete meltdown.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It turns out that 26.Ng5, though the best in the position, wasn’t the right move for that particular player at that particular time. The less tactical 26.Nd2 would probably have served her better. I know that claiming someone would do better to avoid the best move sounds insane, but if you aren’t able to tame the resulting positions then it’s best to play something within your personal range. Another way of putting it is this: the best move isn’t the best move if you don’t know why it’s best.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The moral here is: when possible, try to enter lines that you feel you can handle and that suit your personal comfort level, your style, or that particular situation. For example, if I could take a small but solid (and safe!) positional plus vs. grandmaster Shabalov (a man who lives for hyper-complexity) or enter a tactical minefield that might very well offer much more, I would go for the small but solid/safe option unless I was able to convince myself that the complications were definitely good for me, that I had enough time left on the clock to do the position justice, and/or that I could handle it properly without sinking under a maze of variations. On the other hand, if I felt that entering a tactical firestorm was the <span class="italic">only</span> correct way to handle the position, I would happily enter it—you have to do what the board tells you to do!</p>

			<p class="float-text">When possible, try to enter lines that you feel you can handle and that suit your personal comfort level, your style, or that particular situation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On a higher level, patience (and the avoidance of enemy counterplay) is <span class="italic">the</span> major part of the technical repertoire. This kind of refusal to enter anything that’s even remotely risky when possessing a technically winning position (as demonstrated in our next example) is known as <span class="italic">Cat and Mouse</span>.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Black has a horrible position—his d-pawn is an obvious target, his Queen is locked away on h7, his pawn-like Bishop is serving a purely defensive function, his King is being eyed by white’s Queen, Knight, and Bishop, and White enjoys a space advantage in the center and on the kingside. Worst of all, Black has nothing to attack and no counterplay of any sort—he just has to sit there and wait for the axe to fall.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"> In such situations, many experienced players begin a game of Cat and Mouse. They go out of their way to avoid any counterplay, and they refuse to activate any enemy piece. Instead they slowly improve their pawns and pieces until everything is optimally placed. And then (and <span class="italic">only</span> then!) they take aim at some juicy target(s) and enjoy a “snack” (winning a pawn in this fashion adds to the overall advantage and lets the enemy know that he’s not only lost in the middlegame, but also in most endgames)—however, the snack won’t be eaten if doing so would allow the opponent sudden activity.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This kind of total domination doesn’t occur too often, and when it does some players prefer to seek ways to end things a bit faster. But the Cat and Mouse idea makes good sense since it allows the stronger side to keep his opponent completely under his thumb, to avoid any and all tricks, and to pretty much guarantee victory at some point down the road. Also keep in mind that the defending side will be thoroughly miserable throughout this process, and will sometimes just resign so he doesn’t have to continue looking at the sickening sight that’s in front of him.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White prepares to improve the position of this Rook. To be quite honest, 38.Rxd6! was stronger, but why trade a Rook for that dead enemy Bishop, and why take any chances whatsoever when you’re having such a good time torturing the opponent in slow, delicious fashion? After 38.Rxd6 Bxd6 39.Rxd6 Black would find himself facing some serious threats. Here’s an example of what might occur:</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-79" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-4"/>Lazy/Soft Moves</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When I was thirteen and deeply addicted to chess, I hung out with two other chess kids—both were considerably better than me. The oldest and strongest, Peter Wise, kindly looked over my games and gave me advice. One incident always stuck in my mind: I was White and had tossed out about 10 moves of some opening when I played h2-h3. Peter then posed one of the hardest questions anyone had ever asked me—“Why did you play that move?” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I was stumped! Thinking about it, I finally said, “It was my move and I had to do something.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, this sounds incredibly basic, but over the years I’ve posed this exact question hundreds of times to students during lessons and chess fans that attended my lectures who ranged in rating from 1000 to 2300. And, I often got a similar reply to the one I gave so many decades ago: “I didn’t know what to do.” “It looked good so I played it.” “I was low on time so I played this fast to gain time on the clock.” “It threatened his Queen so it had to be good.” I say these are similar because in each case the person responding didn’t really know what was going on in the position and just did “something,” hoping to figure out the truth later in the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The fact is, when you’re playing a game you should generally be able to lecture on your position at any given time. You might not be right about all the details—in fact, you might be completely off base. But at least, in your mind, you would have a handle on the goings on and, as a result, be able to make moves that conform to that knowledge and certainty. Even a 1200 player can say, “Well, I have an advantage in space so I pushed this pawn in an effort to get more.” The pawn push might be good or it might be bad, but at least it would conform to his version of the board’s reality.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Naturally, my whole idea of imbalances is designed to give you something to grasp onto. Whether you fully grasp imbalances or have only a faint inkling, recognizing them will give you the guidance everyone needs to make an informed decision (or at least feel confident when playing a move that’s completely bonkers—even misguided confidence counts for a lot!).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The point of this section, though, isn’t about imbalances per se—it’s about a player failing to make use of knowledge he already possesses when pondering a move, or a player being too lazy to even bother making the effort to find something worthwhile.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once again, the cure for this “it was my move and I had to do something” nightmare starts with an awareness of the problem that the particular position is posing to you. And, when I teach, I go to the next step by telling my students, “Before you make any move, be aware that I’m going to ask you to describe every detail of this position after the game’s over, and I’ll want you to tell me how the move you played catered to those details.” Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter if the student gets things right or wrong. What does matter is the effort he makes—it’s that effort that trains his mind and ultimately helps him acquire the good chess habits that will serve him for the rest of his life.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s take a look at three examples, moving up the rating ladder in each game.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="Teradeath--1100----Khilane08--1100---Yahoo-Online-2009"/>Teradeath (1100) - Khilane08 (1100), Yahoo Online 2009</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Qf6 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 208</p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Teradeath wasn’t expecting 2…Qf6. Here he needed to ask, “This seems strange. You’re not supposed to move your Queen right away because it can be vulnerable to attacks by the other pieces, so how I can take advantage of 2…Qf6?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">That’s all it took; he didn’t need a deeper understanding of the position than that to come up with a promising move. In the game White gave up on trying to capitalize on his opponent’s move and played passively with 3.d3, which frees the c1-Bishop but blocks the other Bishop on f1! Does White really have to punish his light-squared Bishop if he wants to spank …Qf6? Anyway, Black was so freaked out by the “threat” of Bg5 (a classic “I can’t allow it!” moment) that he replied with 3…h6 (ignoring the threat by 3…Nc6 4.Bg5 Qg6 was fully playable) and White suddenly got with the program and continued 4.Nc3 c6 5.d4 with the superior position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Instead of moving the d-pawn twice, the most obvious move is also the best:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Nc3 Nc6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now 3…c6 4.d4! (This once again makes Bg5 “on” and also initiates quick central play in order to try and punish black’s premature Queen move.) 4…exd4 5.Bg5 Qg6 6.Qxd4 leaves White with more central space and a significant advantage in development.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Nd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Hard to resist—White brings his Knight to a nice square and attacks the enemy Queen at the same time. Of course, the quiet 4.Bc4, bringing the Bishop to a very active diagonal, also makes good sense.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…Qd6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’m only giving this poor move to show how simple but logical moves like 3.Nc3 can often put so much pressure on an opponent that he can easily make a serious mistake. Instead of 4…Qd6, 4…Qd8 was far safer, though White can be happy with the result of the opening after 5.Bc4 or 5.d4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">5.c4!</span> A move that is purely opportunistic. White wants to overwhelm Black by making use of the tender nature of c7. That requires energy (quiet positional play is no longer called for), so White will do everything in his power to force black’s Queen to move away and lose touch with its defense of c7. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is playing very actively, but one thing isn’t kosher in this position: his King is still in the middle. Is it wise to open up the position before you castle? That alone should excite White and make him dream of ways to completely rip open the center so he can reach the enemy King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game, White played 9.a3 when 9…f4 gives Black serious attacking chances. Clearly, 9.a3 didn’t even try to punish Black—it was a lazy move that simply recreated patterns White was familiar with (gaining queenside space with a3 followed by b4). He was playing on autopilot and not even addressing his opponent’s moves. If he had stopped and taken stock of the imbalances of this situation (White has a hole on d4 while Black has a kingside space advantage; White’s only plus is that centrally placed enemy King), he might have realized that a static plan wasn’t the answer and that a dynamic solution was called for (we’ll explore the static/dynamic concept in great detail in Part Six, Statics vs. Dynamics). This kind of reasoning takes us to:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.exf5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Taking the position in hand and opening up new lines.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…gxf5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">9…Bxf5 loses material to 10.g4 when Black gets some, but not enough, compensation after 10…Bd3 11.gxh5 Qh4 12.Na4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The problem with 9…gxf5 is that the h5-Knight is suddenly hanging out to dry—nothing is protecting it. White immediately takes tactical advantage of this fact.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">10.d4! </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 211</p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The position has undergone a drastic transformation!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…exd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Better is 10…Bb6, but then moves such as 11.b4, 11.Be3, and 11.Nd5 all give White a pronounced advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.Nxd4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Giving white’s Queen instant access to the d1-h5 diagonal and threatening Qxh5+.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold"> 11…Nxg3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Another bloody example is 11…Bxd4 12.Qxh5+ Kf8 13.Bd5 Qd7 14.Bh6+ Bg7 15.Rae1 Ne5 16.f4 and Black can quietly give up.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">12.Nxc6 bxc6 13.Bxc6+ Bd7 14.Re1+ Kf8 15.Qd5 </span>and the double threat of 16.Bxa8 and 16.Bh6 mate are more than Black can handle. Clearly, the robotic 9.a3, though a common idea in the English Opening, wasn’t right for this particular position. As should be evident, a fresh look can pay huge dividends.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Although these last two examples showed how lazy thinking led to missed dynamic and/or tactical possibilities, the same can be said about positional ideas. In the following game we witness a high-class example of a very astute chess outlook.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="J.-Rowson---L.-Cooper--Walsall-1997"/>J. Rowson - L. Cooper, Walsall 1997</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.c4 b6 2.d4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb7 4.a3 f5 5.d5 Nf6 6.g3 g6 7.Nf3 exd5 8.cxd5 Bg7 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">This position features a central space advantage for White, a battle for the important e4-square (Black would like to airlift his b8-Knight there—he usually accomplishes this by …Na6-c5-e4), some early black pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal, a strong d5-pawn that needs tending else you might drop it, and the fact that White will be better if he can finish development and place his Rooks on c1 and d1. Note that …d6 for Black is problematic since that would weaken the c6- and e6-squares (White would eye them with Bg2 followed by Nd4).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There’s a lot of tension in this seemingly simple position, and the going can get tricky. Most players would toss out 9.Bg2 without thinking, but Rowson didn’t fall victim to that kind of soft thinking. Instead he realized that he might be able to make serious gains if he could deprive the b8-Knight access to c5 by making b4 a possibility. Since the immediate 9.b4 fails to 9…Ne4, he came up with:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Rb1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Extremely nice! Now that the Rook is off the a1-h8 diagonal, b2-b4 is suddenly a viable idea. To be honest, I’m not convinced this is actually stronger than 9.Bg2 Na6 10.Bf4, but that doesn’t matter—the fact that he kept his hand away from the f1-Bishop and actually thought, “Maybe there’s something better. Maybe I can isolate that Knight and deprive him of his usual play.” is far more impressive than most combinations.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…0–0 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black meets an extraordinary idea with a generic reply. Small wonder that he soon finds himself in trouble. Instead, he needed to either fight for the right to employ the usual plan (that b8-Knight <span class="italic">must </span>find a way to make an imprint on the central battle!), or try and take advantage of the loss of time that 9.Rb1 entailed. Let’s give a quick look at both:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">9…Na6 10.b4 c5 11.Bg2 (11.dxc6 e.p. dxc6 12.Qb3 Qe7 13.Bg2 might be even stronger) 11…0-0 (11…Qc8 12.Nb5 is good for White, but 11…cxb4 12.axb4 Nc7, putting the despised Knight to work, leads to interesting positions that would be fun to analyze. White appears to have a little something in this line, but I’m not sure how much it really is) 12.0-0 cxb4 13.axb4 Rc8 14.Nb5 Bxd5 15.Bf4 Rc4 16.Bd6 Re8 17.Be5 favors White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Okay, our all-too-brief look at the thematic 9…Na6 didn’t inspire confidence, so let’s see if the second option is workable—how can Black try to make something of his lead in development? 9…Qe7! is critical, when White has to be careful about b2, c3, and d5: </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Seeking help from my silicon master, Rybka offered up the following insane variation (from diagram 213): 10.Bf4 Ne4 11.Nb5 (11.Nxe4 fxe4 12.d6 cxd6 13.Bxd6 Qe6 14.Ng5 is a whole other world of complications—Black seems to be okay here too) 11…d6 12.Rc1 Na6 13.Nfd4 (It seems to me that, if this brute force idea doesn’t work, then White should stay on topic and make sure c5 can’t be used by an enemy Knight. Thus 13.b4!? is critical, with 13…0-0 14.Bg2 being a good place to begin another endless analysis for anyone that might be interested) 13…0-0 14.Ne6 Bxb2 (by capturing this pawn, Black ensures that his Knights will have permanent access to the c5-square) 15.Rc2 Bg7 16.f3 Nf6 17.Nexc7 Rad8 18.Nxa6 Nxd5 19.Kf2 Nxf4 20.Rc7 Rd7 21.Rxb7 Rxb7 22.gxf4 Qh4+ 23.Kg2 Qxf4 24.Qd5+ Rbf7 25.Nxd6 Qg5+, draw.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Hopefully this game and illustrative analysis (a true analysis would easily fill several pages) gives you a taste of the psychology and willpower needed in upper level chess: one player comes up with an idea that might allow him to take over the position, and if the other doesn’t match him with a bright concept of his own, his game will quickly go downhill.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The actual game (after 9…0-0) continued:<span class="bold"> 10.Bg2 a5 11.0–0 Na6 12.b4 axb4 13.axb4 c5 14.dxc6 e.p. dxc6 15.Nd4 Qd7 16.Qb3+ Kh8 17.Ne6 Rfe8 18.Nxg7 </span>and White has a clear advantage and eventually won.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Lazy moves often emerge when the hard work in a game is done and you mistakenly think that the rest will play itself. Our next game is a drastic (and painful!) example.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here, after finding all the hard moves and achieving a position that Black could resign with a clear conscience, I relaxed and began thinking about the brilliance of my combination. And, while I was busy patting myself on the back, I stopped playing chess.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.Bb5+? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Amazing. I glanced at this move, saw that it won the Exchange, and just played it without looking for anything better. 24.Qxd4+! Ke7 (24…Ke8 25.Qxh8+ Ke7 26.Qf6+ wins the house) 25.Qb4+ Qd6 26.Rc7+ Bd7 27.Re1+ would have given me the overkill finish that I deserved.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Ke7 25.Qf6+ Kf8 26.Qxh8+ Ng8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Obviously, 24.Bb5+ was winning, but it made things harder than they needed to be. Once you take the “lazy train to nowhere,” you often find it’s shockingly easy to stay on that train until all your good earlier work is undone.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Bd3? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">27.Rce1 with the threat of Rxe6 was crushing. Other easy winners were 27.Qxh5 and 27.Bc4. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27…Qg5 28.Qxd4 Rd8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly Black has a bit of activity. His game is still lost, but now White had to put some work into it, which I was clearly not prepared to do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29.Qb4+ Ne7 30.Bc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">30.Rce1 increases the heat and is still pretty easy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30… Rd2 31.Qxb7 Nd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">At this point I was extremely upset. I knew I had botched things (though White’s still winning) and couldn’t get back on track. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">32.Qb8+ Kg7 33.Qg3?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">33.Rg1 was still winning, but I couldn’t bring myself to play such a defensive move. Wasn’t I mating him a few moves ago?  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here’s what Angus Dunnington (in his book, <span class="italic">Chess Psychology</span>) had to say about this kind of situation: “When a hitherto sweet-smelling game suddenly turns sour we tend to dwell on where we might have gone wrong, or we simply look down on the area of the board where the opponent has just turned the tables and see only these enemy pieces that have done—or are about to do—the damage.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">33…Qxg3 34.hxg3 Ne3 35.Bxe6 Nxf1 36.Rxf1 fxe6 37.Rf4 Rxb2 38.Rxa4 </span>and the game was eventually drawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Years later, because of agonizing failures like the one we just saw, I changed my whole mindset. When reaching a position as in diagram 214, I began to take a long time to soak up every juicy bit of goodness it offered. Why rush when I could lick my lips, take a glance at my opponent’s red, defeated face, and simply enjoy the moment? Then I would jump back into the position and give myself a small challenge: “How can I execute him in the most effective manner? What’s the very best way to mop things up?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, I still had my share of soft move failures, but my newfound concerted effort to retain focus enabled me to avoid a lot of disasters that my earlier attitude would have created.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-80" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-3"/>Pay Attention!</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In my teens and early twenties, one of my biggest failings as a player was the “quick move” (making moves too fast). When it was my turn I’d often just bash a piece on some square (usually planned a few moves before) and expect it to make my opponent swoon. Invariably, the move was either “soft” (not really giving the position what it needed) or a downright blunder. Yet, I wasn’t aware of this habit until Dennis Waterman, a very strong master, told me that he’d watched my games for quite a while and noticed that most of my losses were due to this “illness.” That one bit of insight made a big difference in my subsequent results, though I continued to suffer the occasional relapse right up to the end of my career.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s one of the games Waterman was alluding to.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here I only had two legal moves, and both seemed more than adequate. So I quickly tossed one out and waited for my opponent to resign.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.Ka2?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I thought either King move was 1-0 and I didn’t take any time to verify this opinion.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">26…a4</span> and suddenly I realized that I’d botched another game since now the b3-pawn is hanging with <span class="italic">check</span>. A draw was agreed after 26…a4 (27.Nf6+ Kd8 28.Nd5+). Of course, 26.Ka1 (threatening 27.Rc1) would have won on the spot since 26…a4 followed by 27…axb3 would no longer be with check.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s one more example of a quick move. Hopefully it will prove scary enough to make you seriously think about sitting on your hands and only moving when you are 100% sure about what’s going on and what you want to accomplish. And, of course, make sure the move you intend to play is actually the one your hand is trying to make!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I hadn’t experienced any serious problems in this game and now intended to play 29…Rd6 when a draw would have followed since 30.Rxd6 (30.Rgd1 Rxd3 31.Rxd3 Ke6) 30…Kxd6 31.Kf3 h5 is completely equal.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">However, someone had entered the tournament hall that I wanted to speak to. So, after White played the expected 29.Kg2, I didn’t write down his move or even give the position any thought. I just reached out for the f6-Rook, and in true blitz fashion (though I had lots of time left) moved “it” to the d-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Rd8?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And, as I let this Rook go, it suddenly struck me that I had grabbed the wrong Rook! Fedorowicz gave me a strange look and chopped on d8.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is an Exchange and two pawns ahead and can win as he pleases. In fact, I can imagine Mr. Pavey feeling rather insulted that White was playing on. Rybka likes 1…Kb6 and 1…Kd6, ending all sane checks and forcing White to self-destruct with 2.Bg2 Qg4+ (forcing the exchange of Queens, which really is game over), or 2.Kg2 Qxg5+ 3.Kh3 Qxh6+, which is downright humiliating.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">However, a human tends to like more forcing continuations, so Pavey found something that was both cute and, apparently, devastating.</p>
