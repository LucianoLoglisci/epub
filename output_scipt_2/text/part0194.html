			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0–0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0–0 8.d4 Nxd4 9.Bxf7+ Rxf7 10.Nxe5 Rf8 11.Qxd4 c5 12.Qd1 Qc7 13.Ng4 Nxg4 14.Qxg4 d5 15.Qh5 dxe4 16.Qd5+ Kh8 17.Qxa8 Bb7 18.Qa7 Ra8 19.Bf4 Qc6 20.Qxa8+ Bxa8 - </span>Diagram 69</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has two Rooks for a Queen, but he’s behind in development, black’s Bishops seem quite active, and …e4-e3 (opening up the terrifying h1-a8 diagonal) is in the air. Since white’s Rooks should, theoretically, be able to dominate the Queen if he solidifies his position and kills off black’s activity, Ivanchuk’s move makes a lot of sense.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think most 1400s would notice the potential danger along the h1-a8 diagonal. And, since this section is all about Bishops, it stands to reason that the answer has something to do with them. Thus, 21.Be3, preventing that diagonal from being opened by …e4-e3, is something well within a 1400’s range.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Be3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This blocks the e-pawn, which in turn makes sure that the h1-a8 diagonal won’t become a factor in the subsequent play.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…Qf6 22.c3 Bd6 23.Nd2 Qe5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">An important maneuver for Black. By forcing g2-g3 (24.Nf1 is possible, but then the Knight would be relegated to passive defense), Black hopes to use his Queen and a8-Bishop to take advantage of the subsequent light-square holes that this pawn advance created. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The battle is very interesting: White is doing his best to block his opponent’s light-squared Bishop while Black is doing everything in his power to create new diagonals for it that will ultimately allow game-saving counterplay against the white King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">24.g3 h6 25.a4!</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Opening the a-file allows the a1-Rook to become active. Black will be in serious trouble if both Rooks manage to penetrate into the enemy camp. The battle lines are now clearly drawn: what will invade the hostile position first—white’s Rooks or black’s light-squared Bishop and Queen? The rest of this very complicated game, given with minimal notes, will see both players battling to make their respective goals come true: <span class="bold">25…Bc6 </span>(25...b4?? would be a blunder since it allows White to get rid of one of the enemy Bishops and open new files for his Rooks: 26.Nc4 Qe6 27.Nxd6 Qxd6 28.Red1 Qe7 29.cxb4 cxb4 30.Rac1 and all of white’s dreams have been realized.) <span class="bold">26.axb5 axb5 27.Nb3 Bf8 28.Red1 Bd5 29.h4 Kg8 </span>(After 29...Bxb3 30.Rd8 Kg8 31.Raa8 Qf5 Black’s tied up, but since 32.Rxf8+ Qxf8 33.Rxf8+ Kxf8 34.Bxc5+ is only a draw, it’s not clear if White has any way to make decisive use of the pinned f8-Bishop; Black can easily generate counterplay on the kingside light-square holes. For example: 32.Bf4 [32.Rac8 Be6] 32…Bc4 33.Bd6 Qh3 and suddenly Black is the one in the driver’s seat.) <span class="bold">30.Nc1</span>! (The Knight is heading for f4; if Black can’t achieve counterplay against white’s weakened kingside light-squares, he’s doomed.) <span class="bold">30…g5 31.hxg5 hxg5 32.Ra5 Qc7 33.Ra6 </span>(And not 33.Rxb5? Bc4 when White has nothing better than 34.Rb3, giving up the Exchange.) <span class="bold">33…Qf7 34.Rb6 Be7 35.Rxb5 Be6 </span>(Black’s primed and ready to go on the offensive via …Bh3 followed by …Qf3, or …Be6-g4-f3. Things now get very tense.) <span class="bold">36.Rb8+ Kg7 37.Rb7 Kh6 </span>(37…Kg6!? was probably more accurate.) <span class="bold">38.Re1 </span>(It doesn’t seem right to take this Rook off the d-file and out of the attack. Instead 38.Ne2 appears stronger. The idea is that 38…Qf3?? fails to 39.Rxe7 Bh3 40.Rd6+ Kh5 41.Nf4+! Kg4 (41…gxf4 42.Re5+) 42.Rg7 and Black is dead. Since this is a book of concept and not endless analysis, I’ll leave it to the interested reader to figure out the ultimate worth of 38.Ne2.)<span class="bold"> 38…Qf6??</span> (A blunder. Correct was 38…Bh3 [Finally leaping at his light-square chances!] 39.f4 Qh5 40.Re2 Qf3 and Black is okay.)<span class="bold"> 39.Rb6 Qf5 40.Nb3 Kh5 41.Nd2 Bd7 42.Ra1 Bd8 43.Rb8,</span> 1-0.</p>
