			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess</span> is all about turning you, the chess student/lover of the game, into a player with superb positional understanding and skills. You may ask, “Why do I need another instructive chess book?” The answer is: Look at your rating. Look at your playing strength. Do you feel like you have superb positional skills? If not, wouldn’t you like to have them?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As a chess teacher and, more importantly, as a student of the game that personally ran into many hard-to-scale learning plateaus, I fully understand the frustration chess fans experience when they find themselves frozen at a particular skill level. It’s my belief that every player needs a firm chess foundation to reach his potential, and the lack of such a foundation more or less forestalls any real hope of attaining the chess heights most players dream of.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition </span>was designed for players in the 1400 to 2100 range. A close study of its contents will imbue the serious student with a rock solid positional chess foundation, an appreciation of planning plus an understanding of how to make logical plans based on the needs of the position, and surprising insights into previously ignored areas of chess psychology. By employing new ways of presenting concepts and games, and by making the book feel both personal and fun to read, I’ve done everything possible to ensure that studying becomes a joy and that the material presented—often viewed as too complex for the masses—will suddenly make sense and, as a result, be remarkably easy to retain.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ideally, this fourth edition should be read from beginning to end. However, two indexes add to the ways the book can be read. One acts as both a games’ index and a list-of-players’ index, and can be used to find all the games in the book by a favorite player or, at a glance, just see who played whom. The other index is about chess concepts, and can prove to be a very useful study tool—for example, if you wish to study isolated pawns, just look that up in the index and go to each listed page. This lets you make a detailed examination of any particular concept that interests you.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A word about the examples: you’ll notice that I’ve used games by grandmasters and also games by amateurs! I’ve used new games, and I’ve also used games from the seventeenth century! I made use of blitz games from the Internet, and even used the blitz players’ online names. I have a simple philosophy: if a position or game is instructive, it’s important. I don’t care if Kasparov played it, or if it’s beginner vs. beginner. In fact, lower rated games and/or blitz games often feature the kind of errors real players make, and this makes the example far more personal for a large range of readers. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To top it all off, I didn’t shy away from employing humor if I felt it added to the lesson being taught, or improved the book’s overall readability. Who said that it’s not possible to study chess, learn advanced concepts, and laugh at the same time? I tell stories in the book that push home a point and also entertain. I used online handles because they are colorful and add to the example’s fun-quotient. Why shouldn’t chess study be fun?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I honestly believe that a thorough study of this book will take you on an enlightening journey that, ultimately, will shatter your old chess misconceptions and drag you laughing into a Golden Age of chess understanding and chess enjoyment.</p>
