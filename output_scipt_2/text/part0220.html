			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that the c-pawn is the big target in this position and that Fischer is dying to chop it off. But this isn’t a case of embracing one’s “inner greed.” Instead it’s the logical culmination of one player creating weaknesses in the enemy camp, surrounding it/them, and finally feasting as the targets fall. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Clearly, the acquisition of material plays a huge part in chess strategy, but ideally one would like to do so in a controlled manner. Thus, one must take a few things into consideration: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If too many pawns are exchanged, the side with a pawn less will, in some cases, still get serious drawing chances.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>In one’s zeal to win material it’s easy to allow unnecessary counterplay. Thus, Black should do his best to avoid giving White more play than he deserves.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Which minor piece has more impact in the battle along the c-file?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since 1…Rxc4 fails to 2.Nc6 Rxc1 3.Nxe7+ Kh8 4.Rxc1, black’s correct move is self-evident.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Would a 1400 want to prevent Nc6? No doubt about it! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bxd4! 2.Qxd4 Rc8 3.Rc2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">On 3.Qe3 (hoping to pick up e7 and a7 for c4 and d5), Black would get his a-pawn off the vulnerable rank by 3…a5. Then the threat of …Rxc4 is once again “on” since he would be winning two pawns on c4 and d5 for the lone e7-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Rxc4 4.Rxc4 Qxc4 5.Qxa7 Qe4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This fine centralizing move holds onto e7 (remember to retain as many pawns as you can and optimize your winning chances—the defender in such situations usually tries to exchange as many pawns as possible), stops the counterplay that would result if White were allowed to chop on e7, and prepares a long siege against both a2 and d5. Black still has every intention of winning a pawn, but he’ll only take it on his terms!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Intending to resume the hunt against a2 by …Ra4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Rd1 Kg7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It never hurts to improve the position of one’s King. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Qb7 Qe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not only stopping any checks on b2 and eyeing a2, but also pushing white’s Rook to a passive square.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Rf1 Ra4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So a2 is going to (finally!) fall, after which Black will then turn his guns onto d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Qb3 Rxa2 11.Qc3+ f6 12.Qe1 Qe5! </span>and Black was a solid pawn up and in complete control. The game concluded as follows: <span class="bold">13.f4 Qxd5 14.Qxe7+ Kh6 15.Qf8+ Kh5 16.g4+ Kh4 17.Qxf6+ Kxh3 18.Qc3+ Kxg4 19.Qc8+ Kh4 20.Qd8+ Kh5</span>, 0-1.</p>
