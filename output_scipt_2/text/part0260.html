			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has been busy grabbing space for some time—he started with a bit more central territory after 10.d4, then he began annexing queenside space with 13.a4, 14.b4, and 15.a5, and the last move, 21.c4, continued the space-gaining trend. Clearly, Black can’t afford to let this continue!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Things seem very complicated and it would be easy to miss white’s intention to take on e5 followed by c4-c5 with a huge spatial clamp. Thus I gave this problem a high rating spread. Of course, I hope you lower rated players did notice white’s threat to envelop the queenside and, by doing so, proved me completely wrong about what the spread should be.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…Bg7?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Instead of stopping white’s plan of world domination, Black quietly developed his Bishop to a reasonable looking square and let White have his way! By now we know that the indignity of suffocation can only be tolerated if some sort of counterplay allows the spatially challenged side to make use of enemy squares weakened by the forward marching pawns, or if we have our own things happening in another sector of the board, or if the space gaining pawns can be viewed as attackable targets. In the position that occurs, Black achieves none of these things and thus ends up with an uncomfortable, passive position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though 21…Nh5 is more aggressive than 21…Bg7, White still retains an edge with 22.dxe5 Nf4 23.Qf1 Nxe5 24.Nxe5 dxe5 25.Nf3 Bg7 26.Rd1 Qc7 27.c5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Clearly best was 21…exd4! 22.Bxd4 Nh5! when both 23.g3 c5! and 23.Ba1 Nf4 24.Qf1 Bg7 25.Bxg7 Kxg7 26.g3 Ne6 give Black his full share of the play.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Note the difference between our three choices: Both 21…Bg7 and 21…Nh5 allow White to consolidate his advantage in space while leaving Black with little or no counterplay. The far more combative 21…exd4! gives Black a fluid position with pieces that are poised to jump to life, and pawn breaks (…c5 or …d5—often mixed with …bxc4) that can rip things open at the drop of a hat.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Clearly you don’t want to sit around twiddling your thumbs while enemy space envelopes you in its web. Fight back!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">22.dxe5 dxe5 23.c5 </span>White’s advantage in space is now obvious. Black’s pieces are inactive and he doesn’t have any targets to strike at. The rest of the game is given without comment: <span class="bold">23…Nh5 24.g3 Qc7 25.Rd3 Rbd8 26.Rd1 Nf8 27.Nf1 Rxd3 28.Qxd3 Nf6 29.Ne3 Bb7 30.Kg2 Qb8 31.Bb2 Qc7 32.Bb3 Re7 33.Qd8 Qxd8 34.Rxd8 Nd7 35.Nh4 Kh7 36.Nhf5 gxf5 37.Nxf5 Bf6 38.Nxe7 Bxe7 39.Re8 Bg5 40.Bxf7 Kg7 41.Bb3 Bf6 42.f4 Ng6 43.f5 Ngf8 44.h4 Kh7 45.Kh3 Kg7 46.g4 Kh7 47.Bc1 Bg7 48.g5 hxg5 49.hxg5 Kh8 </span>and Black resigned without waiting for the reply. 1-0.</p>
