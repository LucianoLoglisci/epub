			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I constantly hear amateurs discussing their styles. Usually they love to brag about how attacking is everything to them, while a smaller number pride themselves on a solid grasp of positional concepts. Though there’s nothing wrong with enjoying one part of the game over another, if you can’t show at least basic skills in both you’ll be in for a very rough ride. So a good positional player will find that he’s doomed if he doesn’t also have a solid grasp of tactics <span class="italic">and</span> a feel for chess dynamics, while a good tactician will be beaten from pillar to post if he is positionally clueless and/or doesn’t know a static plus or minus from a hole in the wall. In other words, personal tastes are wonderful, but at least a modicum of balance is key if you want chess success.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The positional fantasy is to create long-term static problems in the enemy camp (holes, weak pawns, a material deficit, lack of space, etc.) and then “massage” these things while the opponent passively sits around until his position totally collapses into a pile of dust. On the other hand, the tactician dreams of knocking his opponent out with a massive tactical punch, or unleashing a stunning combination that overwhelms his gutted prey. Nice thoughts indeed, and these scenarios do occur quite often at all levels. However, this presupposes that the guy on the other side of the table will stick his chin out to be hit, or that he’ll roll into a ball in the face of your positional superiority. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">But what if the opponent sees your tactical trick coming? What if he realizes that his game is a positional mess and dares to fight back, refusing to go quietly into that dark night? What if he has some favorable imbalances too, and fully intends to make maximum use of them?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The best chess games are all about the war of ideas, the battle of imbalances, and the face-to-face struggle of one player’s will against the other—if you don’t have a fighter’s mentality, if you wilt in the face of an opponent who grabs the positive features of his position and comes at you again and again as if he was a rabid dog, then you will find that chess success and real chess enjoyment eludes you. A to-the-death battle of mind and knowledge and skill and heart is what makes chess so exhilarating!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">And all of this brings us to the enormously important battle of Statics vs. Dynamics—the fight between one side’s long-term plusses (we’ll concentrate on superior structure here) and the other’s short-term, use-them-now-or-die, chances (active pieces, attacking possibilities based on a vulnerable enemy King, or swing-from-the-fence tactics that seemingly appear from nowhere but are actually a logical expression of basic combinative rules).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This chapter is designed to make you aware of the eternal war between a “firm foundation” (positional/static factors) and a “firm fist” (dynamics). It’s something you have to take into account when you build your positional dreams or try to create an attack—will the attack fizzle out and leave you a cropper to the opponent’s obvious static gains? Will your obvious structural superiority win out or will it fall on its face when the active enemy pieces invade and conquer?</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Worst pawn structure ever?</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black is a pawn up, but do doubled isolated a-pawns count as full pawns? And what about tripled e-pawns? One can understand white’s decision to enter this position—he felt that his structural superiority was so enormous that the position simply had to be better for him. In fact, if one stares at black’s pawn structure while refusing to look at anything else, it would be hard not to break out laughing. However, only looking at any position through static-tinted lenses will rarely get the job done.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And this begs a question: What about dynamics? And here we arrive at the flaw in white’s thinking—he didn’t take his opponent’s plusses into account! Let’s break things down:</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">White</span>: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Far superior pawn structure.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Active Rook (which is rightfully targeting black’s weak pawns).</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">Black</span>: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>White’s King (which is stuffed into a corner and vulnerable to eventual back rank problems) can’t take part in the coming battle (it’s a liability), while black’s King can give support to e7 and e6 via …Kf7 (it’s making itself useful).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s Rook is also active, and if white’s Knight moves then …Rxc2 turns the Rook into an all-devouring beast.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The tripled e-pawns aren’t as bad as they seem—the e6-pawn in particular supports the d5-square and allows …Nd5.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Once black’s Knight leaps to the wonderful d5-square, it will hammer open the c-file and prove to be far more useful than its white counterpart.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Once black’s Knight moves, the g7-Bishop will take immediate aim at white’s queenside. Conversely, white’s Bishop isn’t attacking or defending anything and is swishing thin air along the h2-b8 diagonal.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s a pawn up.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">To sum up, the real picture is very much in black’s favor: it’s a battle of white’s structural superiority versus black’s enormous advantage in dynamics. Note that all of black’s pieces are serving an active/dynamic function—his King can defend key points in its camp, while the Rook, Knight, and Bishop will join forces and tear down white’s queenside. White’s pieces, on the other hand, are all over the place and aren’t working together at all.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Nd5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Active pieces call for active play! This move immediately optimizes black’s minor pieces while also ripping open the c-file so the Rook can join in the party.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.Rxa6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White starts gorging on the crippled pawns. Alternatives weren’t attractive either:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>24.Nxd5 exd5 25.c3 and now the calm 25…Rc6 is probably best, though 25…d4 26.cxd4 Bxd4 also leaves Black in complete command of the position.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>24.Nxe4 Rxc2 25.h4 gxh4 26.Bxh4 Bd4 27.Rxa6 Kf7 28.Ra4 e5 and black’s active pieces rule the roost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Kf7!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Making good use of the King. The e6-pawn is protected, Rxe6 is avoided, and Black is finally ready to hammer away on c3 and/or c2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Rxa7 Bxc3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black realizes that it’s better to retain his Knight since its ability to attack any square on the board (compared to a Bishop, which is always stuck on one colored complex) will make it a more flexible piece than white’s remaining minor. I should add that the Knight covering the c7-square also turns out to be of considerable importance—3...Nxc3? 4.bxc3 Rxc3 allows 5.Rc7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.bxc3 Rxc3 27.h4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">27.Ra2, though passive, was probably white’s best defensive try.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The tripled e-pawns show that they also have a dynamic side! Compare them to white’s “healthy” pawns, which are sitting around doing nothing.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, the battle of Statics vs. Dynamics regularly occurs at the highest level. And it’s very common to see the Static vs. Dynamic paradigm created right in the opening.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="V.-Topalov---L.-Aronian--Morelia-2008"/>V. Topalov - L. Aronian, Morelia 2008</span></h6>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is a popular line in the Nimzo-Indian. White has the Bishop pair but also has trouble with his pawn structure (the doubled c-pawns are weak). If Black can exchange one of the enemy Bishops or restrain the Bishops’ activity in some way, he’ll have excellent chances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since this is clearly a Dynamic (two active Bishops and a lead in development) vs. Static (superior pawn structure for Black) situation, White has to <span class="italic">insist</span> that his Bishops somehow reach their full potential.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 274</p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb"><span class="bold">15.f4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This actually makes white’s pawn structure even worse (since he’ll soon have an isolated e-pawn to go with his isolated a-pawn and doubled isolated c-pawns), but structure isn’t on white’s mind—activity is! The advance of the f-pawn intends f4-f5 with chances on the kingside. And, if Black captures on f4 (which he does) then the c1-Bishop will join its light-squared brother on a diagonal superhighway.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…exf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To me, this seems like strategic capitulation since White will achieve all his dynamic goals (of course, it takes some powerful chess by Topalov to prove this). In my view, Black should play 15…Re8!?, a move that highlights white’s potential problems down the e-file and intends to meet 16.f5 with 16…e4!, blocking the g2-Bishop’s diagonal. Note how my recommended response doesn’t play into white’s hands like 15…exf4 does. Instead it contains the enemy Bishops and hopes to take advantage of white’s structural defects. Philosophically (in accordance with my concept of imbalances), 15…Re8 is the way to go, but whether this actually equalizes is up to future analysts. After 15…Re8 16.f5 e4 we reach an important position:</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 275</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The critical move is 17.g4 (17.Qf4 Qxf4 [17…Qa5!?] 18.Rxf4 Nf6 19.g4 h6 20.h4 b6 21.g5 [21.Be3 Ba6] 21…Nh5 22.Rxe4 Bxf5 is nothing for White) when Seirawan says, “White wants to play Qe3-h3, Bc1-f4, g4-g5 and to try to deliver mate. I do agree that 15…Re8 makes sense and the question is whether White’s ‘attack’ is really dangerous or not.” This uncertainty in the face of two different philosophies is what the Static vs. Dynamic battle is all about!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Rxf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly the position has become wide open and Black will have serious trouble getting his queenside pieces out. When two vastly different sets of imbalances come head to head, it only takes a blink for one strategy to overrun the other.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…a5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black is hoping to get his a8-Rook in the game by …Ra6.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very nice. Black’s Knight is pinned and the threat of Bd5 looms large.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s Bishops are eating up the h2-b8 and h1-a8 diagonals and his Rooks are far superior to black’s. Black has completely lost the strategic battle. The rest of the game is an exercise in futility.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…h5 24.Be4 Re6 25.Rxe6 fxe6 26.Bd6 Rf6 27.Rd1 Kf7 28.Bf4 Kg8 29.Bc7 Rf7 30.Bg6 a4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">At first glance this seems surprising, but it turns out that Black loses decisive quantities of material no matter what he tried. For example: 30…Rf8 31.Bd6 Rf6 32.Be8 Rf5 33.Be7 Nf8 (33…Nf6 34.Bxf6 Rxf6 35.Rd8 is also resignable) 34.Rd8 Ba6 35.Bg6 and the position looks more like a teenage slasher film than a chess game.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Many structures become raging Static vs. Dynamic battlefields. One of the most interesting (to me) can be seen in the diagram that occurs after the following eight moves: <span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 0–0 6.f3 Ne8 7.e4 b6 8.Bd3</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If Black wasn’t familiar with the general structure in diagram 277, he might be tempted to follow up with …Bb7 followed by …d6 and …Nd7. However, those “normal” developing moves would demonstrate a complete lack of understanding about the dynamics/statics of the position. The fact is, this kind of structure (which most commonly occurs in the Nimzo-Indian but can also arise from other openings) is seething with mutual bad intent. White claims two Bishops, a huge pawn center, and kingside attacking chances (dynamics). Black targets the c4-pawn for death (going after a static weakness).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once you realize that c4 is the target, then you will also understand that …Bb7 can’t be right since it has nothing to do with pressuring the c4-pawn. Placing the Knight on d7 is also illogical since it wouldn’t be contributing to the “kill c4” plan. However, now that black’s goal is clear, his moves should also be clear: 8…Ba6 (hitting c4) 9.Nh3 Nc6 intending …Na5 (hitting c4 again).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I should also add a bit about the “bizarre” move, 6…Ne8. Why retreat to a seemingly stupid square when there’s no need to do so? As it turns out, e8 is a very flexible square for the Knight—it gets out of the way of its f7-pawn, which can now help block a white attack by a well-timed …f7-f5. In some cases, it can add to its King’s defenses by …g6 and …Ng7. And it can also join in the group assault of c4 by …Nd6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Take a look at the following game where the same basic structure arises and the same plans are employed (hard to believe they knew this stuff 140 years ago!). It’s a flawed battle, but serves as an excellent illustration of a cut and thrust Static vs. Dynamic war.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Rushing to win the c4-pawn, but white’s dynamics prove to be of more value.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White has—at least temporarily—managed to hold onto c4, and now he’s pursuing his kingside dreams via the threat of f4-f5. However, the aggressive 14.f4 isn’t all juicy goodness—the move suffers from a strategic flaw.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…f5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Freezing white’s f-pawn and thus turning it into a traitor—the white f-pawn now blocks its dark-square Bishop while black’s f-pawn makes sure that white’s light-squared Bishop and g3-Knight will never be able to use the e4-square. Thus white’s minor pieces now find themselves trapped in a sort of cage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A common (and often strong) maneuver in this kind of position is 14…Qa4, bringing another piece to bear on c4. However, though it succeeds in tearing down c4 (the final realization of his static plan), it also lets White continue with his dynamic kingside plans via 15.f5. This advance gains kingside space, frees the e3-Bishop by opening up the c1-h6 diagonal, and also brings the previously dead f1-Rook into the game. Is rushing to win c4 really worth giving White all of this activity? A possible continuation would then be 15…Bxc4 16.fxe6 and now Black can try:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s critically important to know if the position demands static or dynamic play from you. At times there might be a choice about which direction you’ll take, but more often than not, the writing is on the wall and there’s only one correct decision. Ultimately, taking that correct path is dependent on you looking for it in the first place, and a correct reading of the imbalances. Done right, the board will usually scream (quite loudly!) what’s expected of you.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s plusses are black’s lag in development (dynamic) and uncastled King (dynamic).

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black must make a big decision</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here we have a fairly common looking isolated d-pawn position (though the position of white’s Queen on b1 is odd). In general, this structure immediately tells us that Black will have a long-term static plus (play against the isolated d-pawn and the weakened d5-square) while White will find dynamic compensation in active pieces and chances against the enemy King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This generic scenario would indeed play out if Black played the natural positional move, 11…c6, giving support to the d5-square and intending to follow up with …Nbd5. Since normal moves like 12.Re1 Nbd5 13.Ne5 give Black a comfortable game after 13…Be6, White might be tempted to slam down 12.Bxh6!? gxh6 13.Qg6+ Kh8 14.Qxh6+ (14.Bxf7 Nh7 15.Ne5 Bxe5 16.dxe5 Qe7 favors Black since 17.e6? is met by 17…Bxe6! 18.Bxe6 Rf6) 14…Nh7, though it’s more or less equal after 15.Ne4 Be7, giving us a nice example of black’s static material plus vs. white’s dynamic (attacking) chances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I think most players would toss out 11…c6 if they were sure that 12.Bxh6 wasn’t dangerous (and, as the above analysis shows, this would be a fully acceptable decision). But it turns out that Black doesn’t have to accept his static role, and can actually change the “personalities” of both sides with a rather surprising (non-dogmatic) move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11…Be6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black accepts a weakening of his structure for iron control over the d5-square and, after 12.Bxe6 fxe6, use of the just-opened f-file. This dynamic, original decision creates a position that very much suits Morozevich’s original, active style. Suddenly White (who a moment ago was the active one) has static play against the weakness on e6 while black’s active (dynamic) pieces will give him chances of his own.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.Bxe6 fxe6 13.Re1 Qe8 </span></p>
			<p class="float-title">in a nutshell</p>
			<p class="float-text">Note that White has to be careful not to let Black create (by swapping one of his Knights for a white Knight and his d6-Bishop for the other white Knight) a monster Knight (firmly entrenched on d5) versus an inferior Bishop scenario.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not too subtle. Black envisions his Queen leaping to h5 and chomping down on white’s King. A more restrained interpretation of black’s plan would be 13…Qd7 14.Ne4 Nxe4 15.Qxe4 Rae8 with a solid, completely acceptable position. However, Morozevich most likely wanted to make the game as sharp as possible, thinking that his fourteen-year-old opponent wouldn’t be able to handle the heat.</p>
