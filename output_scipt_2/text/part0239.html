			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This was a battle for first place. John Grefe, who won the U.S. Championship in 1973, was half a point behind his Canadian opponent (who won the Canadian Championship in 1972 and 1975) and needed a win to take the event. And, it seemed he was going to get it! He had outplayed Biyiasas, was three pawns up, and seemed well on his way to the American Open title.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Peter Biyiasas was famous for his defensive powers and his never-say-die attitude—he fought to the bitter end in every game he played. Be that as it may, nothing could have saved him if White had played 40.Ra7. However, how could an obviously strong move like 40.Ra8 be incorrect? The threat of Rf8 (ending all counterplay on f4) followed by Qa8 (creating a nasty mating threat) seems to end the game quickly.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This is an extremely tough one and calls for calculation, inspiration, and a devious mind!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">40.Ra8?? Nf4+ 41.Bxf4 Rxf4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Grefe had anticipated all this and had prepared something he thought was a clear winner. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After the game the spectators insisted that 41.Bxf4 was a blunder and that both 41.Kf1 and 41.Kg1 were winning, but it turns out that the game was drawn in any case: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>41.Kf1 Qc7 with the idea of  ...Qc4+ gives Black enough counterplay to draw.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>41.Kg1 Nxh3+ 42.Kg2 (42.Kf1 Qb6 and White can’t win) 42…Nxf2! draws while 42…Qe6 also suffices to hold the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">42.Rd8</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is the move Grefe had counted on—surely Black would now resign? The idea is that 42…Qxd8 43.Qxf4 gives White a winning Queen endgame, while 42…Qc7 43.Rd7! also does the job.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White could also have tried 42.Ra6 but Black hangs on: 42...Qxd4 43.Qe3 (43.Qg3 Qd5+ 44.Kh2 Qd2, =) 43...Qd5+ 44.f3 Qxg5+ 45.Kh2 Qf5 46.Ra5 Qxa5 47.Qxf4 Qxa2+ with a draw. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">42…Rg4+!</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Has Black gone berserk? No, it’s the point of his earlier play, which White completely missed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">43.Qxg4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And not 43.Kf1?? Qa6+ when Black wins! The only other try is 43.Kh1 but then we see a slightly different version of the same stalemate that occurs in the game: 43…Qh2+ 44.Kxh2 Rg2+ 45.Kh1 Rg1+, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">43…Qg3+! </span>The final point. The players agreed to a draw since 44.Kxg3 (44.Kf1 Qxf2+ 45.Kxf2 is the same result) leads to immediate stalemate. A stunning save! Our “pay attention” motto is very pertinent here, since White was not paying as much attention to his opponent’s defensive chances as he should have. On the other hand, Black was playing close attention indeed to every possible trick the position offered him.</p>
