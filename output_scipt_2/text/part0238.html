			<p class="caption3">How should he defend d4?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.Bg5 f6 3.Bh4 Nh6 4.Nc3 Nf5 5.Bg3 h5 6.Qd3 h4 7.Bf4 g5 8.Bd2 Nc6</span> - Diagram 201</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s aggressive opening play has left him with kingside space but also kingside weaknesses. Both sides need to deal with their central King since things can get nasty if one side’s monarch gets stuck in the middle while the other castles to safety. Since White can’t afford to get too defensive (that would leave Black with an easy development and the aforementioned space), he has to take a stand and ignore black’s pseudo-threats to d4.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: King in the center, not bowing to enemy threats, pushing one’s own agenda. If these things don’t spur you into to action, then nothing will. I have full faith that my 1400 rated audience will shine here.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.0–0–0! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So white’s King has found a home and he’s remained flexible—White can develop with Nf3, tighten with e3, or smash open the center with e4. The ball is now in black’s court; how will he react to all of this?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Kf7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s King isn’t completely happy here and I would think that he should have been able to do better than this. Since it’s clear that 9…Nfxd4 10.Qg6+ has to be avoided, and that 9…Ncxd4 10.e3 Nc6 11.Qxd5 gives White a small but bothersome pull, one would deduce that Black should play with more energy—thus 9…Be6 makes a lot of sense (it covers the weakened light-squares and prepares to castle via …Qd7 and …0-0-0). In that case some really interesting complications could erupt that would test both sides’ imaginations: 10.Nf3 g4 (10…Qd7, simply intending to castle, seems the most sane: 11.e4 dxe4 12.Qxe4 Nd6, =. Also interesting is 10…Nd6!?) 11.e4 and now:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…Qd7 12.exd5 Bxd5 13.Nxd5 Qxd5 14.c4 Qd7 15.d5 has to make White happy.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…dxe4 12.Qxe4 gxf3 13.Qxe6 Nfxd4 14.Qg4 and White is on top.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>11…Nd6 (locking horns!) 12.exd5 Bf5 13.Qe3 Bh6 14.Qe1 Nb4 15.Bxh6 gxf3 16.g4! Bxc2 17.Bf4 Bxd1 (17…c6!?)  18.Qxd1 c6 (18…Na6 19.Qxf3) 19.Qa4 Nxd5 20.Nxd5 b5 21.Nxf6+ exf6 22.Qb4 Nc8 23.Bd3 and white’s two killer Bishops (mixed with black’s vulnerable King) leaves him with much the better of it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.e3 e5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As you can see, when you stand up to your opponent’s threats and force him to master the position or drown under it, more than a few players will crumble under the pressure! His 9…Kf7 was the first misstep, and 10…e5 is a serious error that loses a pawn. Instead, the sensible 10…Be6 would have been playable (developing and keeping everything firmly defended), though perhaps a bit more comfortable for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The rest of the game, though no longer fitting our theme, is quite exciting and well worth checking out: <span class="bold">11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Qxd5+ Qxd5 13.Nxd5 c6 14.Nc3 Be6 15.Nf3 Nxf3 16.gxf3 h3 17.Ne4 Be7 18.Bc3 b5 19.b3 a5 20.Be2 a4 21.Kb1 axb3 22.cxb3 Rhb8 23.Rhg1 Rd8 24.f4 Rxd1+ 25.Bxd1 gxf4 26.Bh5+ Kf8 27.Nxf6 Bxf6 28.Bxf6 fxe3 29.fxe3 Nxe3 30.Re1? </span>(One gets the impression that mutual time pressure influenced the following moves. Correct was 30.Bd4 with a firm grip on the position.)<span class="bold"> 30…Bf5+ 31.Kb2 Nd5 32.Bd4? </span>(A serious mistake that loses his advantage. 32.Bh4 retained a plus.) <span class="bold">32…Kg8? </span>(Missing 32…Rxa2+! 33.Kxa2 Nb4+ 34.Kb2 Nd3+ 35.Kc3 Nxe1, =) <span class="bold">33.Re5 </span>(33.Re8+ Rxe8 34.Bxe8) <span class="bold">33…Rf8 34.Bc5 Nf4 35.Kc3 </span>(35.Bxf8 Nd3+ 36.Kc3 Nxe5 37.Bd6 Ng4 38.Kd4 is winning) <span class="bold">35…Rf6 36.Bf3 Ne6 37.Be3 c5 38.Bc6 b4+ 39.Kc4 Kg7 40.Bd7 Nd4 41.Bxd4</span>, 1-0.</p>
