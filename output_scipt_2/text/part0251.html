			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has a lead in development and black’s King is still in the center. This screams for immediate action!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Solving this one called for recognition of the central state of black’s King, and of 13.f5, which tries to start a war before the enemy King manages to run to safety. You didn’t need to do more than this to solve it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.f5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White had to get the ball rolling since both his advantages (development and black’s central King) are temporary (black’s King will eventually castle and he’ll eventually catch up in development). Thus, I knew that I had to use it or lose it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Once again, I’m trying to instill in you a primal desire to kill whenever you see a King in the center. First comes recognition of the opponent’s possible predicament, then comes the desire to punish it, and finally comes a cool and calm look at what is really going on in that particular position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13...gxf5 14.Bxe7?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I can’t be sure (it was a lifetime ago), but I think I was moving quite quickly here. That’s the only explanation I can give for ignoring the far stronger (and obvious) 14.Ng3! Of course, moving fast in such a rich position is imbecilic, but I probably had worked out (when I explored 13.f5) a line I liked and ran for it as fast as possible. Oh well, my target-loving heart was in the right place, but my aim was off. You can see a proper discussion about quick (lazy) moves in Part Four, Various States of Chess Consciousness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Qxe7 15.exf5 Bb7 16.Ng3 Be5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Better choices were 16…h5, 16…Qg5, and 16…Qh4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Qh5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A case of seeing a good move and not looking for a better one. The simple 17.fxe6! dxe6 (17…fxe6 18.Qh5+ and 17…0–0–0 18.exf7 are both unplayable) 18.Qh5 Bxg3 19.hxg3 would have left Black in serious trouble due to the threat of Bxe6. Choices such as 19…0-0-0 20.Rxf7 and 19…0-0 20.Rae1 Rae8 21.Qg4+ Kh8 22.Qxd4+ are extremely grim.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…Bxg3 18.fxe6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This good move is what prompted me into tossing out 17.Qh5. Now 18...Bxh2+ 19.Kxh2 dxe6 20.Bxe6 favors White, as does 18...dxe6 19.hxg3 (this transposes into the note to white’s 17th move). So Black is forced to sacrifice a pawn, but that also turns out to be nice for me.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18...0-0-0 19.exd7+ Rxd7 20.hxg3 Qe3+ 21.Kh2 Rd6? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The threat of 22...Rh6 is dealt with by a nice maneuver by the White Queen. Far better resistance could have been had by 21…Rg8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">22.Qg4+! Kb8 23.Qf4! Qxf4 24.Rxf4 Re8 25.Raf1 Re2 26.Rf6! Rxg2+ 27.Kh3 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black has managed to restore material equality, but this is only temporary—his many pawn weaknesses (which brings up a whole different form of Target Consciousness!) leave him in a hopeless position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27...Rg1 28.Rxd6 Rxf1 29.Rxb6 Kc7 30.Rb4 Bf3 31.g4 Kd6 32.Rxd4+ Ke5 33.Ra4 h5 34.gxh5 f5 35.Kh4 Bc6 36.Rc4 Bb5 37.Rb4 f4 38.Re4+ Kf6 39.Ba4 Kf5 40.Kh3 Bxa4 41.Rxa4 Rh1+ 42.Kg2 Rc1 43.Rc4 Kg4 44.h6 Rd1 45.h7 Rd2+ 46.Kg1 Rd1+ 47.Kf2 Rd2+ 48.Ke1 Rh2 49.Rc7 f3 50.d4 Kg3 51.Rg7+ Kf4 52.d5</span>, 1-0. The leap from one form of Target Consciousness (Central King) to another (weak pawns) is very common.</p>
