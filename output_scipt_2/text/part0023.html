			<h3 class="chapter-descripton">Speed Demons of the Diagonals </h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">While Knights slowly but surely hop and leap to whatever areas of the board they wish to go to, Bishops (Also known in various insane circles as bellhops, bees, and wily angle-sliders. Two Bishops are, on occasion, also referred to as two Jans or, oddly, two Rabbis.) can roar across the length of the board in a single move. It lives for speed, and this little Formula 1 racecar makes anything that dares step onto its diagonal potential road-kill. This means that if those diagonals aren’t blocked, the Bishop can be a fierce and highly prized piece.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Bishops have historically been viewed as being either <span class="italic">Good</span> (the player’s center pawns are on the opposite color as his Bishop) or <span class="italic">Bad</span> (the player’s center pawns are on the same color as his Bishop). However, I no longer like these terms, deeming them anti-intuitive and at times confusing. For example, bad Bishops can often be active and, as a result, very strong. Or bad Bishops can also be critically useful defenders. Thus, in this book we’ll refer to Bishops as <span class="italic">Active</span>, <span class="italic">Useful</span>, or <span class="italic">Tall-Pawns</span>.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is considered <span class="italic">Active</span> if it’s outside the pawn chain and/or enjoying life on a reasonably clutter-free diagonal.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is considered <span class="italic">Useful</span> if it’s doing an important (defensive or dynamic) task(s). Such a defensive Bishop can be ugly to look at, but its absence would cause your position to undergo serious difficulties.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is said to be a <span class="italic">Tall-Pawn</span> if it’s not serving a useful function and is trapped behind its pawns (thus making it inactive). This kind of Bishop takes on the persona of an overgrown pawn that, sadly, can’t turn into a Queen if it reaches the end of the board.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s take a deeper look at each of these Bishop-types.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-27" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-16"/>The Active Bishop</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Give a Bishop a diagonal that’s uncluttered by soda cans, pens, its own pawns or a solid/well-defended wall of enemy pawns (pieces aren’t clutter) and we’ll consider it to be active. This doesn’t mean that an active Bishop can singlehandedly bring down the enemy position or that it will even successfully mesh with the rest of its army. That’s up to you and your skills at getting all your bits to work together for a particular goal. But an active Bishop can dash from one sector to another in a flash, so they always need to be respected.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 48</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has two active Bishops here—his c4-Bishop eyes the f1-a6 and the a2-g8 diagonals, while his other Bishop patrols the c1-h6 line. Black’s light-squared Bishop is also active since it eyes the c8-h3 diagonal (the d7-Knight isn’t considered clutter because it can move out of the Bishop’s way whenever it wishes to). However, black’s e7-Bishop isn’t particularly active because it’s blocked by the d6-pawn. Of course, it does keep an eye on the shorter d8-h4 diagonal, and it also gives d6 solid support, so it’s not close to being a Tall-Pawn. In fact, this Bishop can easily become something special after a …d6-d5 push frees thef8-a3 diagonal, or it can assume diagonal supremacy if White ever captures on e5 (dxe5) since recapturing by …dxe5 would unlock its potential.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This shows us that a Bishop can become active at the drop of a hat, and that innocent looking pawn exchanges (dxe5) can easily turn a dormant enemy piece into an active one. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Why are all the Bishops in diagram 48 at least reasonably active? Because the center is fluid and can open further if pawns are exchanged. However, a couple poor moves can change all this: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…c5?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I’m sure the e7-Bishop didn’t appreciate this move! This unfortunate advance also turns d5 into a gaping hole.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.d5?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White also seems to be oblivious to the needs of his minor pieces! With one push of the pawn, the d5-hole has been plugged and the c4-Bishop blocked. Talk about self-defeating! Instead, 2.dxe5 Nxe5 3.Nxe5 dxe5 4.Qe2 would leave Black with that hole on d5, while the e7-Bishop’s potential has been greatly reduced. Also note that white’s light-squared Bishop is a real fire breather on the a2-g8 diagonal.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">Bishops are usually strongest in open positions. The fewer pawns in the way of a Bishop the greater its scope.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the position from diagram 48, everyone started out with nice Bishops. But more often than not you’ll find that your Bishop isn’t setting the board on fire. What do you do then? Being a fan of the <span class="italic">Wizard of Oz</span>, I tried closing my eyes, clicking my Birkenstocks together and saying, “There’s nothing like an active Bishop. There’s nothing like an active Bishop.” Sadly, it didn’t have the desired effect—when I opened my eyes the Bishop was still sitting there doing nothing. Clearly, inactive Bishops will remain that way unless you do something about it! In other words, if you possess a lazy Bishop that is sitting around daydreaming, you have to find a way to put the thing to work. This mix of Bishop-awareness (knowledge) and willpower can be quite effective.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">Every time you move a pawn, check to see how it affects the activity of your Bishops! Obviously, turning an open position into a closed one will have a serious effect on these pieces, so train yourself to always take the health and care of your Bishops into account.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A student of mine was playing White and he couldn’t wait to show me this game. When he reached this position he stopped and said, “I have pressure against d6 but it’s defended by the Knight and the Rooks will soon come to its defense too. My Bishop isn’t doing anything and suddenly I remembered how you constantly yell at me about how I allow my pieces to stay out of play. I got really angry and thought to myself, ‘Not this time!’”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.c5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Excellent! This is the kind of move that makes teachers proud. Suddenly the slacker on e2 will jump to c4 where it will be incredibly active. We also can’t forget that this pawn sacrifice blows open the d-file for the doubled Rooks.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…dxc5??</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This leads to annihilation. He had to try 1…Rad8 2.cxd6 Rxd6 (2…Nxd6 3.Qd4 a6 4.Bc4+ Nxc4 5.Qxd8 Rxd8 6.Rxd8+ Kf7 7.R1d7 is game over) 3.Rxd6 Nxd6 4.Qd4 Nf7 (4…Rd8 5.Bc4+ wins on the spot) 5.Qxa7 and white’s extra pawn, combined with black’s loose King, should ensure victory: 5…Ne5 (5…Rd8 6.Rxd8+ Nxd8 7.Qd4 h5 8.Qb6 Kg7 9.b4 Qd7 10.a4 Qd2 11.Bf1 is pretty easy since Black is tied down to the defense of d8 and b7. White will end things by pushing his queenside majority and making a crushing passed pawn.) 6.Ba6 (If this tactic wasn’t here, then White would play 6.Rd5 with a huge advantage) 6…Rf7 7.Qb8+ Kg7 8.Bxb7 Qc7 9.Qxc7 Rxc7 10.Bd5 Rc2 11.b4 Nd3 12.Bb3 and White is winning.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2.Rd7 Qe8 3.Bc4 Rb8 4.Qf6 b5 5.Be6 </span>White’s pieces work together beautifully, and the Bishop has gone from a useless lump of wood on e2 to a slayer of all things on e6. At this point purplecoyote, not wanting blood to gush from the screen, wisely resigned.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Two other things that distinguish an active Bishop is its ability to stop enemy passed pawns from a distance and its use as a “catapult” for its Queen.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Okay, this is a highly exaggerated situation, but it clearly shows the Bishop stamping the whole b1-h7 diagonal with the brand of its authority. Nothing may safely step there, while in the meantime white’s lone pawn, after <span class="bold">1.d6</span>, will waltz into d8 and make a new Queen.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A common but important idea. The Queen uses its light-squared Bishop to set up a catapult (usually referred to as a “battery,” but that term reminds me of a marital debacle so I try to avoid it) that will throw it deep (and decisively) into the enemy position (in this case, on h7). This is also known as “riding the Bishop’s vapors.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…f5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There’s no salvation in 1…g6 2.Bxh6 Nxe5 (Black was lost in any case, but this makes a bad situation worse.) because after 3.Qxb7 Nxd3 4.Qa6 Nb2 5.Bxf8 Bxf8 6.Rfb1 he loses the Knight and leaves White with an extra Rook.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.exf6 e.p. Rxf6 3.Re1 Na5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There’s no real defense.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">4.Qh7+ Kf7 5.Bg5! </span>and now Black has nothing better than <span class="bold">5…Qg8 </span>(5…hxg5 6.Nxg5+ Ke8 7.Nxe6 Rxe6 8.Qg8+ Kd7 9.Qxe6+ Kc7 10.Qxe7+ offers no hope at all) <span class="bold">6.Bxf6 Qxh7 7.Bxh7 Bxf6 8.Be4 </span>and Black doesn’t have enough compensation for the lost Exchange.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-28" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-15"/>The Useful Bishop</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Active Bishops are nice, but at times they are merely claiming domination of unimportant real estate. In that case, you have to find (or create) something for them to do. The dream Bishop is both <span class="italic">useful</span> and<span class="italic"> active</span>—it covers a lot of ground, but it is also serving a very specific (useful) purpose.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is from the game <a id="A.-Volokitin---Y.-Pelletier--Biel-2005"/>A. Volokitin - Y. Pelletier, Biel 2005 (<span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nc6 5.Nc3 Qc7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Qd2 Bb4 8.f3 Nxd4 9.Qxd4 Bxc3+ 10.bxc3 b6</span>)</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s dark-squared Bishop is active in that it eyes two diagonals (g1-a7 and c1-h6). However, the g1-a7 diagonal is blocked (the b6-pawn is a rock) and the c1-h6 diagonal has nothing to do with the battle for the central dark squares (the d6-square in particular is screaming for the Bishop’s attention). In other words, it’s active but not performing a useful function that relates to the other imbalances in the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, white’s potential dark-square control is offset by the weak pawns on the c-file, so Black has his chances too. Nevertheless, even if the chances are more or less balanced, it’s still up to White to pose problems for his opponent by milking his positive imbalances for all they’re worth.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 26 minutes thought, Grandmaster Volokitin played the most principled move.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11…e5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This fine move stops e4-e5 ideas and also chases the Queen off its powerful central post. Worse were:</p>

Bxc4 16.0-0 Bxd3 17.cxd3 and black’s lack of development and central King will leave him with serious long-term difficulties. A sample line: 17…Ne7 18.Rac1 Nc6 (18…Qb8 19.Rxc8+ Qxc8 20.Rc1 Qb7 21.Qg4 Nf5 22.Qe4 Qb8 23.Qc4 and black’s problems remain) 19.Qe4 Qd8 20.d4 and Black is left with an unenviable defensive task.</p>

			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">While an active Bishop might look good, a useful Bishop trades style for substance and addresses the deeper needs (both dynamic and defensive) of a position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The useful Bishop can also be purely defensive:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One would think that White should stand better here. His Bishop is far more active than black’s silly looking thing, while the e6-pawn (sitting on an open file and facing off to a pair of enemy Rooks!) is weak and the e5-square is a gaping wound in the middle of the board. To top it off, White even has the move! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Yet, things aren’t so clear. It turns out that white’s d-pawn isn’t as safe as one might suppose, while the threat of ...Rxf3, shattering white’s King position, is serious and needs to be dealt with. Still, White can avoid that unpleasantness with both 1.Re3 and 1.Ne5. So isn’t White better after all? </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To find an answer to this, we need to address the Bishops. It turns out that the active white Bishop, with its proud trumpeting over its domination of the b1-h7 diagonal, isn’t helping the rest of its forces deal with …Rxf3, or with the weakness of e5 or its own slightly loose pawn on d4. On the other hand, black’s despised mutant on d7 is singlehandedly keeping e6 intact (another way to look at this is that one Bishop is holding off two enemy Rooks!). And, once e6 is no longer in peril, that “inactive” piece can emerge from behind its own lines via …Bb5 or …Ba4 or …Bd7-e8-g6 or …Bd7-e8-h5 and create its own brand of activity outside its pawn chain.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Let’s see how play continued: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Ne5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">1.Re3 Rxf3! (My student, MrSchlock, missed this idea earlier when he blitzed a move to gain some time on the clock. He insisted that he wouldn’t have missed it again.) 2.Rxf3 Rxf3 3.Be2 Rxf2 4.Kxf2 Qh4+ 5.Kg1 Qxd4+ 6.Qxd4 Nxd4 and Black, with two good center pawns for the Exchange, has no reason to be unhappy.  </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">2.dxe5 makes no sense since it fills the hole on e5, turns the d5-pawn into a passer, and blocks both white Rooks.

This kind of Bishop takes on the persona of an overgrown pawn and is something you should desperately try and avoid having.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The worst cases of Tall-Pawns occur when a Bishop finds itself entombed. Here’s a graphic example:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A true nightmare for White! This kind of Bishop usually loses in the middlegame and the endgame—in both cases, the side with the entombed piece is, in effect, playing with a piece less.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here black’s only concern is getting his King to e2 where it can start vacuuming up all of white’s kingside pawns. There is only one way to accomplish this goal.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This turns the a4-pawn into an outside passed pawn. Once white’s King is forced to the a-file so it can capture the a-pawn, black’s King will have a clear path to e2-nirvana.</p>

While teaching it to him, I pointed out a typical device that I assured him would occur from time to time.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The problem with black’s position is the Bishop on g6 (it really does look like a Tall-Pawn, doesn’t it?). This unfortunate piece can’t emerge on h5 (white’s Queen is keeping that square under wraps), and if it tries to escape to f7 or e8 (via …f7-f6—of course, f7 and e8 don’t look so great either) then the e6-pawn will turn into a seriously weak target.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s Re5 not only prepares to double on the e-file (making sure …f7-f6 can’t be played), but it also prevents a potential …c6-c5 break.

Nevertheless, he needs to activate his pieces, even if it loses a pawn (anything is better than sitting around waiting to die). Thus my recommendation is 24…Rde8 25.Qf4! f6! 26.Rxf5! (Not falling for 26.Rxe6? Qxf4 27.gxf4 Rxe6 28.Rxe6 Rg8 29.Kf1 Bf7 winning the Exchange.) 26…e5 27.dxe5 fxe5 28.Qh6 Rd7 29.Rf3 e4 30.Rfe3 Rf8 when white’s a solid pawn ahead (and obviously better), but all of black’s pieces are dancing to their own tune (an active army always gives you at least some fighting chances).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Black was obviously used to people trying to swap their dark-squared Bishop for his and, apparently, he had learned to avoid it with this little Rook move. The idea is that Bh6 can now be met by …Bh8 when the Rook would no longer be vulnerable to the white Bishop on h6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">To the uninitiated, this might sound quite profound. However, it’s also completely wrong! The truth is that, in this particular position, Black should welcome the exchange of dark-squared Bishops with open arms! There are a couple reasons for this, but the most pertinent is that the g7-Bishop is a Tall-Pawn that’s trapped behind its chain. Yes, it does defend some squares, but all in all it’s a pretty ugly piece. This misconception on black’s part rears its head again in a few moves.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White also fails his Bishop exam! His g2-Bishop isn’t very happy, so White needs to activate the thing by getting it outside the pawn chain. Thus 14.Bh3 is correct (<span class="italic">Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain!</span>).

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Both sides are getting solid Fs in Bishops 101. White needed to feel his g2-Bishop’s pain and play 17.fxg6, unlocking the h3-c8 diagonal. Yes, it sacrifices a piece, but this was now necessary thanks to white’s blocking that diagonal with f4-f5 (<span class="italic">Try not to entomb your own Bishop behind its pawn chain!</span>). It turns out that the capture on g6 is very strong: 17.fxg6 when Black has:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Poor metapuff is still trying to retain his Tall-Pawn. Instead, 17…g5! 18.Bxg7 Kxg7 shines a very different light on the position. In that case Black wisely got rid of his inactive Bishop while keeping white’s f-pawn on f5 (thereby turning the g2-Bishop into a Tall-Pawn). The resulting situation is very comfortable for Black, who has a safe King and enjoys a Knight in a closed position versus an inactive white Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.fxg6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Suddenly White wakes up and smells the stagnating Bishops!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…hxg6 19.Bh3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">19.h4 followed by 20.Bh3 is probably even more accurate. Nevertheless, 19.Bh3 proved more than adequate to turn the tide permanently in white’s favor. The rest of the game is worth looking at just so you can see how strong a Bishop can become if you manage to get it outside the pawn chain: <span class="bold">19...Nc5 20.b4 Na6 21.a3 Nc7 22.Qc2 Re7 23.Qd2 Nb5 24.Be6+ Kh7 25.h4 Nxa3 26.Kg2 Nb5 27.Rh1 Nc3 28.Rcf1 Qxb4 29.h5 g5 30.Bxg5 fxg5 31.Qxg5 Rg7 32.Qf5+ Kh6 33.Qf6+ Kh7 34.Bf5+ Kg8 35.Qe6+ Rf7 36.Bh7+ Kxh7 37.Qxf7+ </span>(37.Rxf7+ mates)<span class="bold"> 37…Bg7 38.h6 Qb2+ 39.Rf2 Qxf2+ 40.Kxf2 Nxe4+ 41.Kg2</span>, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This just goes to show that knowing strategic concepts in a theoretical sense is one thing, while being able to actually notice it and put it to use in a real battle situation is quite another. And make no mistake about it—this inability to turn knowledge into practical application goes right up the rating ladder. One student (during our first lesson), rated 2150 FIDE, got angry when I began to talk about the proper use of minor pieces. He said, “I already know all that stuff!” Yet, as we went through his games, he would fail to implement any of it. Instead of treating his minor pieces right, he constantly got sidetracked by “more important” thoughts (material, attack, etc.). Naturally, when he lost to superior players, he rarely understood what went wrong.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’ve all heard of the strange goings on in relation to <span class="italic">Bishops of opposite colors</span>. Aren’t those things supposed to make endgames unwinnable even if you’re a gazillion pawns down? Are we supposed to court them or avoid them? Is it true that the Apocalypse is upon us if Bishops of opposite colors appear on every board, at the same time, in the same round, of the same grandmaster tournament? I run into questions like this all the time!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, Bishops of opposite colors is merely a Bishop vs. Bishop battle. Yet, it’s a strange battle that resembles a war between two creatures in different dimensions. Because they will live on different colored diagonals until they are placed in the after-game box, the Bishops can’t touch, they can’t defend what the other attacks (or attack what the other defends!), and if you place your pawns and/or King on the opposite color of the enemy Bishop, the ghost-Bishop will find that it can’t touch anything at all.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Okay, this is an insane position! But though it’s ridiculous, it does a very good job at showing how absurd a Bishops of opposite colors position can be. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here White is two pawns and three pieces ahead. Black is passive, and white’s King is also far better placed than black’s. Yet, the game is a dead draw! How can this be?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The problem for White is that his armada of dark-squared Bishops can’t touch a light square if their lives depended on it. This means that the only white unit that can attack the c6-square and the g6-pawn is the King. And, since those two targets are so far apart, white’s King can’t skip from one to the other in a single move. Thus, Black will always have a “pass” move with his King (...Kc6-d7/d5 and back to c6 over and over) or Bishop (...Bh5-d1-h5-d1, etc), depending on the direction white’s King has gone.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Let’s look at some moves: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Ke6 Bd1 2.Kf7 Bh5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">2…Bc2?? loses to 3.h5 gxh5 4.g6 when black’s remaining piece will soon have to sacrifice itself on g6 or g8. This tells us that the black Bishop must do two jobs: 1) Defend g6 if it’s attacked. 2) Never lose contact with the h5-square. That way h4-h5 can always be met by ...Bxh5 when White fails to get a passed pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bce5 Kd7 4.Bd6 Kc6 5.Kf6 Kd5 6.Ke7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Threatening to take control over c6 by Kd7. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Kc6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now we see that whenever white’s King is ready to challenge for the c6-square, black’s King must immediately scurry back to c6 and let his light-squared Bishop take over the passing duties.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Bc3 Bd1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black must avoid 7…Kd5?? 8.Kd7 Bg4+ 9.Kc7 when White has gained control over c6, thereby freeing the c5-pawn.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Ke6 Bg4+ 9.Kf7 Bh5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">9…Bf5?? 10.h5 wins.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Kf6 Kd7</span>, 1/2-1/2 since White can’t make any progress!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that if we remove three of white’s Bishops from diagram 61, we would get a more realistic endgame where White can’t win with two healthy extra pawns. And this is where the quasi-truth that “Bishops of opposite colors often allows the defender to draw otherwise lost endgames” comes from. But please note the word “often.” Many endgames with Bishops of opposite colors are also won.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not a happy move, but 32…Bxe5 33.Ng6+ followed by 34.Nxe5 leads to a hopelessly lost King and pawn endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">33.Nd5+ Kd6 34.Kc4</span>, 1-0. No muss, no fuss. Getting rid of the opposite colored Bishops made the whole winning process smooth and worry free.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though Bishops of opposite colors do increase the defender’s chances of holding an inferior endgame in many cases, the same opposite colored Bishops favors the attacker (in a middlegame or endgame) if more pieces appear on the board.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is two pawns up. However, his queenside majority is frozen by black’s a-pawn and Bishop. What really makes black’s life a living hell is the combination of white’s Rook and Bishop hitting f7. This completely immobilizes black’s army and leaves him waiting helplessly while White improves his position. The heat against f7, combined with the extra kingside pawn, ensures an easy victory for White.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White calmly brings all his pieces to their optimum positions before starting the final assault. When your opponent is helpless, enjoy the luxury of putting every part of your position in perfect order.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Bb4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s Bishop is forced to keep a permanent eye on b4 since 6…Bb2 allows 7.b4! axb4 8.a5 when the black b-pawn isn’t going anywhere (thanks to the opposite Bishops) while white’s passed a-pawn will confidently head for a transformative experience on a8.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.e6 fxe6+ 8.Bxe6+ Kh8 9.Kg6 </span>and Black will soon be mated.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To show you how important the existence of the Rooks was to white’s cause, let’s look at the same position, sans Rooks.</p>
