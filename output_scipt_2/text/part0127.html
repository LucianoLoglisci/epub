			<h3 id="_idParaDest-104" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-11"/>The Great Land Grab</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, space isn’t something amateurs hold in high esteem. Material—yes. Attack—yes. Doubled and/or isolated pawns—yes. All these things are solid—you can capture material, you can win weak pawns, and you can place a huge X on the head of the enemy King and embrace an all-out seek-and-destroy operation against it. But space? Is it really that important?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The answer, of course, is a resounding “Yes!” Ask players who have been squeezed to death by Petrosian, Karpov, or Seirawan—all masters of spatial gains—just how important it is. In fact, an advantage in space is one of <span class="italic">the</span> most highly prized imbalances among modern grandmasters.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">And this pep talk takes us to a short but critical question: “Why?” Let’s answer this with a visual image—a large guy staying in an average sized hotel room for twenty-four hours is, more or less, comfortable. But take that same person and cram him into a airplane bathroom and you’ll see him falling apart both physically and emotionally—locked into such a small space, you can hardly move, there’s nowhere to go, and little can be done. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now imagine putting your opponent into that same situation on a chessboard. His pieces have little scope. There’s no room to maneuver, and his Bishops, Knights, and Rooks tend to get in each other’s way. You take your time, improving the position of your pawns and pieces at leisure, watching your opponent’s face for signs of impending emotional collapse. He’s uncomfortable, helpless, and all he can do is sit there and hope you can’t find a way to deliver a deathblow. Who wouldn’t feel despair when living out such a scenario?</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">All of history’s great positional players coveted space because it deprives the opponent of room and dooms his pieces to a life of inactivity. Embracing a love of space is a must for players that want to improve their game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Our first example, a Karpov masterpiece, illustrates all of this in a clear and impressive manner. Understanding all of this game’s nuances isn’t important. What <span class="italic">is</span> important is to acquire a feel (and respect!) for the power of space and how it’s there to be used for players of any level.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Karpov shuts down all of black’s queenside possibilities. Note that …b6-b5 is now impossible, and …c7-c6 creates (after White captures on c6) pawn weaknesses on b6 and d6 and also hands the d5-square to white’s Knight.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">What does this mean for each side’s chances? It doesn’t bode well for Black! The second player’s problem is that he can’t initiate active play anywhere on the board. The queenside offers a long-term white plus (thanks to a possible b2-b4 advance), and the other two zones (center and kingside) belong to White thanks to his extra territory in those areas. </p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Pawn breaks are lurking</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If Black has no way of opening up the queenside, then white’s King will feel very safe there. This also allows White to play for line-opening breaks on the kingside, since his own King will be safely entrenched on the other wing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now it’s time to discuss pawn breaks. In a closed position, pawn breaks are necessary to open lines for attack and to open files so the Rooks can join in the action. Let’s look at each side’s possibilities:</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">Black</span>: </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>An eventual …g7-g5 destroys black’s own kingside pawn protection and is a suicidal idea.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The …f7-f5 advance is the natural break in such a position (black’s c7-d6-e5 pawn chain points to the kingside, which usually means that this is where he wants to play). However, the advance of the f-pawn (after the Bishop moves to d8 or e7 or, after …g6, to g7) carries some serious baggage here—it further loosens black’s kingside pawn cover, it allows White (after exf5) to claim e4 as a home for his Knight, and in many lines it simply helps White penetrate to the black King.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Sacrificing via …b6-b5 might be good at the right time, but only if a series of tactics somehow justify it. At the moment, and for the next few moves, that will most likely not be the case. </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The only break left is …c7-c6—whether it’s good or bad, it probably should be given a try. Better to fight like a cornered badger than to wait around and let the boa swallow you whole. Here’s a sample of what could happen: 17…c6 18.dxc6 Qxc6 19.b3 Qc5 20.Kb2 (20.Bf3 Rfd8 21.Bxh5? b5! [See, it can work from time to time!] 22.axb5 [22.cxb5 Bxe4 and 22.Nxb5 Bxe4 both favor Black] 22…a4! 23.Nxa4 Rxa4! 24.bxa4 Bxe4 25.Rhe1 Qxc4+ 26.Kb2 Bf3!! 27.Bxf3? e4+ 28.Ka3 Ra8 29.a5 Bc3 and it’s over!) 20…Be7 21.Qe2 Rfd8 22.Rd2 g6 23.g4 (23.f3!? followed by 24.g4 also deserves attention) 23…hxg4 24.Qxg4 Qc8 (24…d5 25.exd5 Qa3+ 26.Kc2 b5 27.axb5 a4 28.Rb1 doesn’t quite work!) 25.Qg3 Kg7 26.h5 with a clear advantage to White. As this shows, White retains a clear plus after 17…c6, but things can easily get complicated and White can even fall victim to a crushing attack if he doesn’t sense the possible danger.</p>
			<p class="hanging-indent"><span class="underlined">White</span>:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The b2-b4 break will be huge in an endgame since it will allow White to open queenside lines and penetrate with his King and Rooks. Black doesn’t possess a comparable endgame break.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The c4-c5 break might prove to be a tactical way (in an endgame!) to let white’s King into c4 and beyond.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A well-timed f2-f4 is a very important idea. It gains more central and kingside space and will certainly be on white’s mind.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A well-timed g3-g4 idea is also in the mix.</p>

Being in the filled up car would be intolerable, but reduce the number to three or four and all would be well. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The idea of the spactially challenged side making a few exchanges so that his remaing pieces have room to maneuver is useful in all stages of the game. Here’s a typical opening example:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 4.Nc3 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.e4 g6 7.f4 Bg7 8.Bb5+ Nfd7 9.a4 0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4 12.Re1 a6</span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move and avoid exchanges</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White enjoys much more central space. Note that black’s light-squared Bishop is actually in the way of its other pieces. At the moment, white’s light-squared Bishop is under attack and has to move. 13.Bc4 has been played from time to time, but 13.Bf1 is recognized as correct. Why? Because 13.Bc4 gives Black time to free his Bishop and trade it off: 13…Nb6 14.Be2 Bg4 when black’s forces will have more room to move about (as in <a id="I.-Watson---J.-Nunn--Brighton-1980"/>I. Watson - J. Nunn, Brighton 1980). On the other hand, 13.Bf1 avoids this: 13…Nf6 14.h3! when Black is forced to continue suffering from a certain amount of claustrophobia.</p>

			<p class="float-text">It’s usually a good idea for the side with more space to avoid unnecessary exchanges.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The idea that the side with more territory should avoid unnecessary exchanges might lead one to believe that space won’t be of much use in an endgame since many exchanges would have been made to reach that stage. However, this simply isn’t the case.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has an obvious advantage in space and two Bishops. Though the position is rather closed (a situation that usually makes Knights happy), black’s horses aren’t doing much of anything due to the fact that they don’t have access to any advanced support points (d4 can’t be reached, and an immediate jump to e5 allows White to chop it off with advantage).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is clearly better, but it will take time and patience to actually win.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Nb1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A star move. The Knight is heading for c3 where it stops black’s planned …Nc7 followed by …d6-d5—the white Knight also intends to continue on to a4 where the d7-Knight will be frozen guarding b6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Some players might ask why this is a big deal, since white’s Knight on a4 will be as “frozen” as black’s on d7. That’s an astute observation, but there’s a flaw: once those Knights reach that faceoff position, the d7-Knight will need to be protected from attacks by white’s light-squared Bishop. Thus, black’s one active plan of …d6-d5 won’t work since exd5 followed by Bh3 forces the win of b6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">What all this means is that Black now finds himself with a situation we’ve seen before: no space, passive pieces, no play, and little hope.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So far we’ve looked at positions where one side had a monopoly on space. However, far more common are positions where both sides have space in different sectors of the board. For example, in the King’s Indian Defense it’s common for White to have a huge queenside space advantage (which often allows him to ravage Black on that wing and also to have a marked advantage in most endgames), while Black counters with serious spatial gains on the kingside, which leads to a strong attack against the white King.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">When playing this variation, both sides pretty much know what’s expected of them. The center is closed so play has to be found on the wings. In such positions, you usually want to play on the side where you have more space (of course, there <span class="italic">are</span> exceptions—don’t treat any rule as gospel). Once you determine which side that is, you will try and create weaknesses in the enemy camp, use pawn advances to gain even more territory in your chosen sector, and employ pawn breaks to crack open files for the Rooks so you can use them to penetrate into the hostile position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The following common sequence shows how each side goes about their business:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Ne1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Knight heads for d3 where it will help make the space gaining (and file opening) c4-c5 push possible. In general, your space lies where your pawn chain points—to add to your space (and rip open files) in that area, you need to push the pawn that’s next to your lead pawn. In white’s case the lead pawn is d5 and the pawn you want to push (since e4-e5 is impossible) is the c-pawn. In black’s case the lead pawn is on e5 and the pawn next to it is the f-pawn. Thus, both sides will make use of a <span class="italic">Pawn Cascade</span>: White will play c4-c5 (laying claim to the queenside) and Black will play …f7-f5 (beginning a kingside attack).</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">The use of Pawn Cascades allows you to gain extra space and create open files so your Rooks can penetrate into the enemy position.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Continuing to prepare the critical c4-c5 push.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…f5 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">This well-known line in the French Defense features a clear illustration of pawn chains pointing in different directions and how the structure generally dictates the way each side will play. Black’s f7-e6-d5 pawn chain points to the queenside while white’s b2-c3-d4-e5 chain is taking aim at the kingside. In fully closed positions, this would indicate that Black would eventually attack on the queenside with pawns via …c5-c4 followed by …b7-b5-b4 (taking huge amounts of space and opening up files for the Rooks). White’s plan would be an eventual f2-f4-f5, trying to crash through on the opposite wing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, the French center isn’t necessarily doomed to permanent closure, and this means that both sides have other options. In fact, Black usually makes use of a plan based on pressure against d4 via …Nc6, …Qb6, and …Ng8-e7-f5 with a true team effort against white’s d-pawn! In this line, …Bd7 and …Rc8 also allows Black chances along the c-file once he opens it with …cxd4. Finally, in many lines Black can strike at e5 too with a well-timed …f7-f6 punch.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White, of course, enjoys a central space advantage and usually tries to stabilize it with Nf3, Be2, 0-0 and, at times, even Nb1-a3-c2 giving d4 plenty of support! In some cases White can pursue a kingside attack with pieces (Qg4 and/or Bd3) and at other times he can play to occupy d4 with a piece via a well-timed dxc5 following by plonking down a Knight on the newly freed up square.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4…cxd4 5.cxd4 Bb4+ 6.Nc3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s last few moves were pretty bad (What did you expect from an unknown foe in 1620?), and his rushed exchanges have turned the potential target on d4 into an unassailable rock. This doesn’t mean that Black’s devoid of certain positive imbalances and a clear plan: the c3-pawn is backward and can be attacked by placing a Rook (or the Queen) on the half-open c-file. The c4-square is also vulnerable, and can be occupied by an eventual …Nb8-c6-a5-c4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Be that as it may, White is much better in this position. He still enjoys a spatial plus in the center and on the kingside. He has two active Bishops—the light-squared Bishop will sit on d3 and send out rays of power along two diagonals (f1-a6 and b1-h7), while the dark-squared Bishop might eventually set up shop on a3 and lay claim to the entire a3-f8 diagonal. And, in case you’ve forgotten, the f2-f4-f5 Cascade idea is still there, waiting to be utilized.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">8.Qg4!? was worth considering, forcing Black into unsavory choices such as …Kf8 or …g6 (which weakens all the dark-squares). Note that 8.Qg4 Qa5 9.Bd2 would leave Black with the same problem as before.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Dreaming of an eventual f4-f5 Pawn Cascade. Of course, if the f4-f5 advance doesn’t occur, then the f4-pawn can actually hurt White by blocking his Bishop’s control of the c1-h6 diagonal. Personally, I would have preferred 9.Qg4 Qa5 10.Bd2 0-0 11.Nf3 with a nice attacking position for White.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Allowing White to make his hoped for Cascade a reality. Black had to give 10…h5 a shot (A thematic idea in this kind of position—Black creates an artificial support point on f5 by stopping g2-g4). After 11.0-0 g6 (11…0-0!? is possible, but usually the Rook likes to stay on h8 for defensive reasons) 12.Ng5 (12.Ba3 Ne3) 12…Kf8 13.a4 Kg7 14.Re1 and now the threat of 15.Bxf5 exf5 16.e6 forces Black to play either 14…Re8 (not ideal since the Rook does a good defensive job on h8) or 14…Nce7 (not ideal since this Knight had hoped to jump to a5 and eventually c4). White is better, but black’s position isn’t easy to crack and, if white’s not careful, Black might be able to eventually build up some pressure against c4 and c3.</p>
