			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black was almost certainly winning earlier in the game, but though she gave away a good part of her advantage, she’s still in charge and can confidently look forward to either a win or draw. Like you just did, she noticed the forcing 29…Rc2 (“I played 29…Rc2, White defends everything with 30.Re2, I take, she has to take back, I play …Bc5 and then grind away forever hoping to win.”) and decided that it simplified into an endgame that offered some chances of success, though white’s two Bishops (and the constant dream of exchanging white’s dark-squared Bishop for the Knight, which creates opposite colored Bishops and a likely draw) offered reasonable defensive chances.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game continued according to Miss Koneru’s plan: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Rc2 30.Re2 Rxe2?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here Black was expecting 31.Bxe2 since White clearly “had to take back.” Sadly, something else occurred! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31.Bc4+</span>, 1-0. It’s mate after 31…Re6 32.Bxe6. Many players have been put on suicide watch when nightmares like this happen! But <span class="italic">why</span> did it happen? And, if you fell for the same thing, why did you miss the obvious mate? The answer is simple: once you embrace “He has to” then you see nothing except your own self-imposed lie.</p>
