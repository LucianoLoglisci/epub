			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here Black expected White to recapture the e5-pawn, following the old, “I take you and you take me” paradigm. However, Christiansen (one of the greatest attacking players in U.S. history) is not someone who does anyone’s bidding on the chessboard!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A surprising rating spread! How is such a thing possible? Well, the first move, not making the autopilot recapture, is what I expect from readers of this book in the 1400 class. But Christiansen’s lovely tactical follow up is something that might be missed by players of a very high class.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">33.Rd8</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White will only recapture on e5 if a lull in the action appears that allows him to take without any loss of initiative or momentum.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">33…Rxd8 34.Rxd8+ Kh7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">34...Bf8 loses right away to 35.Qxe5 when the double threat of 36.Qxc7 and 36.Rxf8+ Kxf8 37.Qh8 mate ends the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">35.Qxh5+!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The surprising point of white’s play! Now 35...gxh5 leads to the pretty 36.Bf5+ Kh6 37.fxe5+ (<span class="italic">Now</span> I’ll recapture that pawn!) 37...Qd2 38.Bxd2 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">35…Bh6 36.Qxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A perfect time to recapture the e-pawn—the white Queen not only took a pawn, it also attacks c7, threatens mate on h8, and prevents …Qe1+.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">36…Bg7 37.Qe2 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Many players get so caught up in their attack that they will want to continue in an aggressive vein even if the situation has changed. Of course, if you can profitably bash the opponent some more, then by all means do so. However, usually a successful raid leaves one’s pieces scattered about—they no longer work together for any particular goal. If that occurs, it’s best to regroup, make sure your King is safe, and only then push on in an attempt to acquire new gains.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the position after 36…Bg7 White has a solid extra pawn and two rampaging Bishops. There isn’t any reason whatsoever to risk anything here! Yes, a Rook can be captured but that leaves your King to fend for itself. Indeed, after 37.Qxc7? Qe1+ 38.Kg2 Ne6 White loses his iron grip on the position. An example of what might occur: 39.Qb6 Qe4+ 40.Kf1 Nxd8 (Even 40…Bd4!? 41.Rxd4 Nxd4 42.Bg2 Qd3+ 43.Kg1 Ne2+ 44.Kf2 Nxc1 45.Qe3 Qb1 allows Black to battle on) 41.Qxd8 Qh1+ 42.Kf2 Qxc1 43.Qxe7 Bd4+ 44.Kf3 Kg7 and the presence of opposite colored Bishops mixed with the vulnerable white King would have been something best avoided.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s 37.Qe2 is far more sensible than the madness resulting from 37.Qxc7. White stops all enemy counterplay before it even starts and let’s his opponent know that he won’t be given any chance to recover from his horrible situation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">37…e6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This move, which seems to tighten up black’s position, actually allows another tactical run by White. Better was 37…Qc3, though the position was lost in any case.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">38.f5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very strong! This move frees the c1-Bishop and threatens to disrupt black’s kingside pawn structure. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">38…exf5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black missed white’s reply, which allowed the spectators to get a bit of a thrill!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">39.Qh5+!! </span>Sacrificing itself on h5 for the second time! Black resigned since it’s mate next move: 39...Bh6 40.Qxh6 mate or 39...gxh5 40.Bxf5 mate. Lovely!</p>
