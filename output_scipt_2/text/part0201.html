			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A typical Sicilian structure (but from a Pirc that turned into a Philidor!). Black’s d-pawn is backward (but solidly defended) and the d5-square is weak, but he hopes to get counterplay via …Rfc8 and/or …b6-b5. However, White has a way to play for the creation of a superior minor piece.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Another problem that will prove to be easy for players in the indicated spread to understand and/or solve. Exchanging pieces and leaving yourself with a minor piece that’s superior to your opponent’s is a basic but extremely important strategy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Bg5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White plays directly for a superior Knight vs. Bishop position, which would also create a permanent grip on d5. This move is both thematic and easy to understand: black’s Knights are the guardians of d5, while white’s Bishop will never be able to directly affect that square. Thus, White wants to swap off both black Knights, leaving him with a dark squared Bishop vs. (ideally) a white Knight lording over the board on d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Rfc8 16.Bxf6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not best. Did you notice that white’s f3-Knight had nothing to do with the embattled d5-square from f3? It’s important to hone your board vision so that you quickly recognize when pieces aren’t well placed. One way to tell if a piece isn’t carrying its weight is to ask, “Is my piece helping the rest of the army accomplish the main strategic goal?” If it’s not doing so, it may very well be a slacker!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Correct was 16.Nh2, which instantly brings this Knight into the d5-equation: it intends to continue to g4 where (after Bxf6, getting rid of one enemy Knight) it can exchange itself for black’s remaining horse (creating the hoped for great Knight vs. passive Bishop situation), or it can continue to e3 where it threatens to leap into d5 or f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s important that you appreciate how this maneuver turns a once lazy Knight into an active participant in the battle for d5. Play after 16.Nh2 might continue 16…h6 17.Bxf6 Nxf6 18.Ng4 Nxg4 19.hxg4 Rc5 20.Nd5 Rbc8 21.c3 Bg5 22.g3 when Black has no real counterplay and faces a long, miserable defense due to white’s powerful Knight and the long-term weakness of d6. To quote IM Elliott Winslow: “Burn this position into your memory and learn its nuances; it’s a bread-and-butter Sicilian-killer.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…Nxf6 17.Nd5 Nxd5 18.Rxd5 g6? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">18…f5! would have kept white’s advantage to a bare minimum since 19.c3 Rc5, 19.c4 b5, and 19.Rad1 Qc6 all give Black far more counterplay than he deserved.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">19.c3 Rc5 20.Rxc5 bxc5 21.Nd2 Qc6 22.Nc4 </span>and the Knight was ruler of all creation on c4.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The finish was remarkably smooth since Black was reduced to sitting back and watching White improve his position bit by bit: <span class="bold">22…Kg7 23.Qc2 Qb7 24.Rb1 Qb3 25.Qxb3 Rxb3 26.Kf1 Kf6 27.Ke2 Ke6 28.Ne3 f5 29.f3 h5 30.Kd3 Bd8 31.Nd5 Rb8 32.b4 cxb4 33.cxb4 Kd7 34.g4 hxg4 35.hxg4 Ke6 36.Rh1 fxg4 37.fxg4</span>, 1-0. The superiority of the Knight over the Bishop stands out in the final position. Black resigned because he’s completely passive and has to wait as White builds up for the decisive blow. One entertaining possibility: 37…Rc8 (37…Bg5 38.Nc7+ followed by 39.Nxa6) 38.Rh6 Kf7 39.Rh7+ Ke6 40.Rg7 g5 (the poor Bishop has now achieved full Tall-Pawn status) 41.b5 (Also good is 41.Ra7) 41…axb5 42.axb5 Rb8 43.b6 Ra8 (43…Bxb6 44.Re7 mate) 44.b7 Rb8 45.Kc4 and Black, who is in zugzwang, has to shed massive amounts of material.</p>
