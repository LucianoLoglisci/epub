			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 Nxe4 4.Bd3 d5 5.dxe5 Nc5 6.Nc3 c6 7.Nd4 Be7 8.0–0 0–0 9.f4 Nxd3 10.Qxd3</span> - Diagram 376</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White appears to have a very nice position—he’s ahead in development, he has more central space, and his kingside pawn majority (which has an eventual f4-f5-f6 expansion programmed into its DNA) in particular seems extremely threatening. Kramnik quickly shows that this is all an illusion.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Though we looked at a very similar situation and answer in Part Eight, Passed Pawns (diagram 358), it tends to psychologically disturb a whole range of players to such an extent that I’ve given it a very high level of difficulty. Even masters sometimes can’t bring themselves to play the right move here!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…f5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Handing White a protected passed pawn on a platter! However, it also kills the dynamism of the white pawns. Now Black will: 1) play to increase his control over the blockading e6-square; 2) support his own pawn majority so that he can advance it. Ideally, with white’s e-pawn firmly blocked and his own pawns rushing forward in dynamic frenzy, Black will be able to claim an advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.Nb3 Na6 12.Be3 Nc7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Heading towards e6 while simultaneously giving support to d5 in anticipation of an eventual …c6-c5 advance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.Ne2 b6 14.Nbd4 Ba6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Bishop shows alarming activity.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Qd2 Qe8 16.c3 c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">By taking control over the d4-square, white’s Knights are forced back to squares where they can’t influence e6. Thus 16…c5 wins the e6-square and allows Black to claim victory in the blockading war!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">17.Nf3 Rd8 18.Rfd1 Ne6 </span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">A dream setup for Black</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s vision has come together nicely. He has two Bishops, a firm blockade on e6, and a mobile pawn majority. Also note how white’s pawns on e5 and f4 are blocking their own pieces! Black eventually won (after various errors and adventures).</p>
