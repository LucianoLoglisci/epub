			<p class="caption4">Black is a piece down but saw that she could regain it by …Ng3, extricating her Knight and threatening two pieces at once. How would you assess the position after …Ng3?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Bd3 0–0 6.Nge2 Nc6 7.h3 e5 8.Be3 exd4 9.Nxd4 Ne5 10.Be2 a6 11.0–0 c5 12.Nc2 Be6 13.b3 h6 14.Qd2 Kh7 15.f4 Nc6 16.Rad1 Qa5 17.f5 Bd7 18.a3 Rae8 19.b4 cxb4 20.axb4 Qe5 21.Bf4 Nxe4 22.Bxe5 Nxd2 23.Bxg7 Nxf1 24.Bxf8</span> - Diagram 426</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game White (after 24…Ng3) played 25.fxg6+ fxg6 26.Bf3, retaining an advantage, though Black ultimately drew. However, just because I appeared to accept black’s view that she would regain the piece (and White also accepted it) doesn’t mean that you have to! Don’t buy into your opponent’s (or anyone else’s!) delusion. In this kind of position, you should say, “I <span class="italic">must</span> have a way to win material! I <span class="italic">must</span>!” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Naturally, at times you’ll discover that you don’t have a winner, but at the very least you’ll find that you have a deeper understanding of the position than if you merely went along for the ride. However, in many cases you’ll find something worthwhile or even winning. But without that combative “I must!” such discoveries just won’t happen.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This turns out to be an “I must” problem! I hope you refused to buy into my “Black will regain the piece” smokescreen—in real games, your opponent will constantly try to feed you lies and you have to learn to ignore everything he says and seek your own truth in each and every position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The refutation of black’s concept (after <span class="bold">24…Ng3</span>) was:</p>

			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>25…gxf5 26.Bxd6, hitting the Knight on g3.</p>
