			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The humble Rook (also known in some American clubs as an ox) is the master of files and ranks, but do you fully understand your Rook ABCs? These tests will give you an excellent idea about the highs and lows of your Rook IQ.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
