			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s in trouble and has to make a painful decision: should he capture on d5 or retreat his light-squared Bishop? </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Giving up the Bishop isn’t something one would normally want to do—it’s not only a useful piece, but after 1…Bxd5 both 2.exd5 (threatening to make use of the e4-square with g4 and Ng3 while also looking forward to an enduring attack against black’s King), and 2.cxd5 (intending to continue with the usual kingside attack via Rbf1, g3-g4-g5, etc) favor White. However, like it or not Black <span class="italic">must</span> play that way!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Why the urgency? Why create a tasty square for white’s pieces or leave White with a readymade kingside attack? Why willingly go into an inferior position? The answer is twofold. First, you are <span class="italic">already</span> in an inferior position—we’re seeking damage control, not equality (in other words, you need to be realistic). Second, the retreat leads to a far worse situation!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Though I doubt that everyone would notice the potential strength of capturing away from the center with 1…Bxd5 2.exd5 (though white’s kingside attack after 2.cxd5 is pretty obvious), the real question is whether or not a player will see that f5-f6 is doable after 1…Bd7 since a glance would tell Black that his f6-square is adequately covered. This makes the problem more than just a “don’t let your Bishop get entombed” walk in the park. I would expect many class “C” players to see the downside of 1…Bxd5, but I would also expect many in that rating group to simply miss the tactics that make f5-f6 gin.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bd7? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Like it or not, 1…Bxd5 followed by 2…Nd4 had to be tried.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.f6 Bh8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The pawn can’t be taken. Both 2…Bxf6?? 3.Nxf6+ Nxf6 4.Bg5 and 2…Nxf6?? 3.Bg5 lead to decisive material loss for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bh6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Winning the Exchange while also intending to follow up with a good, old fashioned entombing. Of course, 3.g4 followed by g5 would be the normal recipe since White would, in effect, be a piece ahead. That alone would be enough to make any sane person chop on d5 via 1…Bxd5 (don’t allow your pieces to be entombed!). But why not pick up a Rook and stick the Bishop in a coffin too? Remember that in chess, greed is often a good thing!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I should mention that 3.Bg5 (with the idea of Ne7+) is also extremely strong.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After <span class="bold">3.Bh6 </span>may I dare suggest that 3…Nd4 4.Ne7+ is black’s best option? His suffering would end, and the spectators would enjoy a good laugh.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Other moves are just as joyless for Black:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>3…Nc7 4.Bxf8 Kxf8 5.Nxc7 (5.Qg5 is also strong, but let’s stick to our “piece entombed by pawns” theme) 5…Qxc7 6.g4 Kg8 7.g5 and Black should resign—he’s literally a Rook down (since the thing on h8 may think it’s a Bishop, but we know better).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>3…Nxf6 4.Bg5 (4.Bxf8 also gets the job done) 4…Nxe4 19.dxe4 f6 20.Raf1 is nightmarish.  </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>3…Bxf6 4.Nxf6+ Nxf6 19.Bxf8 Kxf8 20.Raf1 offers Black one of those “I better resign before anyone sees me playing this position” moments.</p>
