			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In a way, a Bishop vs. Knight battle is a pretty clear-cut thing. Here are the basics:</p>
			<h6 class="article1">Owner of the Bishop:</h6>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Make it as active as possible by placing it on a free diagonal, or <span class="italic">creating</span> an uncluttered diagonal if one doesn’t already exist.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Prove that it’s performing a key function and is thus extremely useful.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Steer things into an endgame where the long-range capabilities of the Bishop give it a huge edge over the enemy Knight.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Don’t allow the enemy Knight to find its way to an advanced, permanent support point. This calls for <span class="italic">Anti-Knight Strategy</span>—Do your best to take away all advanced squares from the enemy horse!</p>
			<h6 class="article1">Owner of the Knight:</h6>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Closing the position is often good for your Knight.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Steer for endgames where all the pawns are on one side of the board. This negates the enemy Bishop’s long-range abilities while amplifying the importance of the Knight’s ability to attack both white and dark squares.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Do your best to create a permanent advanced home (support point) for your Knight.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If a tasty support point exists but it seems a long way away (and perhaps impossible to reach), try hard to find a way to get there! It might take several moves, but that’s what moves are for—to place your pieces on their best squares so they can exert maximum effect on the board. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Avoid “Trapped Knight Syndrome”! Many a Knight has been lost when it found itself trapped by the enemy Bishop.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Anti-Bishop pair formula: In the case of two Bishops vs. a Bishop and Knight, the simplest way to remove the opponent’s Bishop pair is to exchange one of the enemy Bishops (either by trading your Knight or Bishop for an enemy Bishop), thus creating a far more manageable Bishop vs. Knight or Bishop vs. Bishop situation.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Two Knights don’t work particularly well together, so exchanging one of them (for an enemy Bishop or Knight) is usually a good idea.</p>
