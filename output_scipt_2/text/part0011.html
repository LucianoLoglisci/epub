			<h3 class="chapter-descripton">Psychopaths of the Chessboard!</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At times, Knights—also known as nerts, neons, jumpers, octopus, squid, and horses—are very much like clowns. They leap over other pieces, they prance about in a strange drunken gait, their movements make them seem almost alien compared to the other chessmen, and they can even make us laugh when we see a Knight do an octopus imitation by forking the whole royal family and estate (attacking King, Queen, and both country homes/Rooks all at once). However, as any clown-wise child will tell you, there is also something scary about them. They seem docile, but behind the facade and horse-like grin is a psychopath, and nothing is safe.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I was watching a student of mine play random 1-minute games on the ICC (Internet Chess Club) and expected him (he was Black) to resign here. Instead, I was witness to something that seemed more like a tragicomedy (or an episode of the Simpsons) than a chess game:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">63…Nf2 64.Be2 Nxg4 65.a6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">“Okay” I thought, “it’s over. Time for Black to give up.” Of course, I couldn’t have guessed that black’s Knight was really some sort of ravenous demon in disguise, ready to go on a binge and devour everything in sight. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">65…Ne5 66.a7 Nc6+ </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">DOH!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">78.Kd4 Nxc4</span>, 0-1. An epic tragedy for White, but Black had to be rather pleased with himself!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I can imagine many of you telling me, “Who cares? White went crazy and gave everything away. Surely a really good player wouldn’t fall victim to such foolishness?” </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This was the final game of the event, and would determine who would earn the title of World Blitz Champion. In other words, they had to play quickly but it was serious business! Anand had outplayed his opponent and now had a forced win. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The god of Knights wasn’t kind to Anand in this game. He missed 29.h7+ Kg7 (29…Kh8 30.Rf1 is easy) 30.Nde6+! (It’s always a scary thing when animals attack.) 30…fxe6 31.Nxe6+ Kh8 (31…Rxe6 allows 32.h8=Q+) 32.Nxc7.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s Knight shows no mercy. Now e5 is still hanging, so White moves it to safety. To be fair, White no longer had a satisfactory reply—the black Knight had already injected its venom into the white position and, as everyone knows, there is no antidote for a horse bite.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">DOH! Yes, it even happens to World Champions. Both Rooks are forked, and there’s nothing that can be done about it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">36.Nf6 Rd8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Moving his Rook to safety. The black fork against e1 and h4 isn’t going away.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">37.Nd5 Rb7</span>, 0-1. White will now lose a full Rook. If I was Ivanchuk, I would have taken that Knight home, framed it, and placed it on the wall so I could give it a loving look every day for the rest of my life.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">These two games have a moral: Knights are very tricky pieces and are fully capable of inflicting untold damage on the enemy position. In fact, if you come across some book that’s trying to convince you that Bishops are a tad more valuable, spit on it and remember what happened to poor Anand!</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">There’s a reason why many amateurs fear Knights—they are very tricky and deserve your full respect!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now that I’ve trained you to see Knights as the fearsome creatures they really are, let’s deconstruct them and see what makes them tick and what makes them sick (and, since Bishops and Knights are always at each other’s throats, we’ll do an occasional comparison between the two):</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are minor pieces (along with Bishops), and are generally given a point-count value of 3 (the same as Bishops).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Minor pieces are an imbalance unto themselves; knowing how to use them properly gives you a huge advantage over the competition.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are the best blockaders of enemy passed pawns. The reason for this is simple: Unlike other pieces, a Knight that’s sitting in front of an enemy pawn isn’t losing any of its mobility. Advantage Knight! See diagram 23 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are short-range pieces. Unlike Bishops, which can slide the length of the board in a single move, Knights are more “restrained”. Advantage Bishop! See diagram 24 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights can jump over other pieces. There isn’t anything else that can do this (Okay, my cat can do it, but he doesn’t count!). Advantage Knight!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights have the potential to attack or defend anything on any colored square—it might take several moves, but eventually they will get there. Bishops are always stuck on one color. Advantage Knight!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights do quite well in closed positions because, unlike Bishops, pawns can’t block them. Advantage Knight! See diagram 25 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights crave advanced support points (i.e., a safe square that can’t easily be challenged by a hostile pawn). Since they are short-range pieces, having access to such a square is a huge part of proper Knight strategy.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights gain in strength as they move further up the board. As a rule of thumb:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight stuck on the 1st or 2nd ranks is a defensive piece and is inferior to a healthy Bishop (a diseased Bishop is quite another matter).</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on the 3rd rank is a flexible workhorse and can be used for defense or attack at a moment’s notice. A Knight on the 3rd often has serious central influence. See diagram 26 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 4th rank support point is a very strong, flexible piece. You can count on it to ably perform both defensive and offensive duties. See diagram 27 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 5th rank support point can be a beautiful thing to behold. It’s a potent offensive weapon and is usually superior to a Bishop. See diagram 28 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 6th rank support point can make children weep and women cry for joy. Here a Knight transforms from horse to Octopus, its many appendages spiking out in all directions and claiming enemy territory as its own. Such a Knight is, at times, stronger than a Rook. See diagram 29 for an illustration.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on the 7th and 8th ranks gives us a case of diminishing returns. Once past the 6th, it no longer controls as many squares since its reach runs out of board. Usually a Knight on such an advanced rank is performing some sort of tactical or search and destroy operation.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is a graphic illustration of the difference between a blockading Knight and a blockading Bishop. White’s Knight is firmly blocking the passed f-pawn, but it’s still a potent attacker thanks to its ability to jump over other pieces. In this case both e6 and g6 are under the gun. In comparison, the Bishop is purely defensive. Since white’s King is free to roam (and black’s clearly isn’t), the game is easily won: <span class="bold">1.Kb4 Be8 2.Ka5 Ke7 3.Kb6 Kd7 4.Kb7 </span>followed by c6 when it’s all over.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It will take the Knight a minimum of four moves to attack the distant pawn on a6 (for example, Ng4, Ne5, Nd3, Nc5). However, the Bishop needs just one move to threaten that pawn (Be2 or Bb7).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s Knight threatens to go to d3 and then chop on c5. Black’s Bishop is very unhappy in this closed position and can’t do anything to prevent this, which means he’s dead lost. If Black gets desperate and gives the horrible <span class="bold">1…a5 2.Nd3 a4 3.bxa4 Bd7 </span>a go, then <span class="bold">4.Nxc5 </span>(yes, 4.a5 is also game over) captures the pawn (which stood on a dark square), hits the enemy Bishop (on a light square), and defends the a4-pawn (also on a light square) all at the same time.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has two Bishops, but White has a lead in development and more central space. The Knight on f1 is giving h2 firm support (It’s hardly a world beater on that square, but it’s serving an important defensive function), while the Knight on c3 puts pressure on d5 and gives support to <span class="bold">1.e4</span>, which adds to white’s space and increases the pressure against d5.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Knight on the 4th rank</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The white Knight is an imposing piece. Aside from defending several squares on the 2nd and 3rd ranks, Black must constantly worry about it leaping to b5, c6, e6, or f5. On top of all that, the Knight is firmly blocking black’s isolated d-pawn and, if it so chooses, can step back and take part in a direct assault against d5 via Ne2, Rd4, Qd2, and Nf4 with enormous pressure against black’s position.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s dynamic Knight is running rings around black’s defensive steed. The e5-Knight is on a permanent support point and is eyeing c6, d7, f7 and g6—all spots deep in enemy territory. Note that black’s Knight can’t make a home on d5 since c3-c4 would chase it away.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Knight on the 6th rank</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is completely hopeless for Black. White’s Knight is a monster, while black’s Bishop is pathetic. Note that the Knight is battering away at several squares deep in black’s camp. Though it’s clear that it would control less squares on the 7th or 8th ranks, the Knight might leap there if it led to material gain or achieved some other kind of dynamic function.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has a couple of devastating plans here. One is Ra3 followed by Rda1, Qa2, axb5, and then a decisive penetration down the a-file. Another idea is Ne4-f6 (a new 6th rank post!), Rd6, etc.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Because Knights are short-range pieces, you need to calmly march them to the desired post. This might take two or three moves, but it’s something that needs to be done. Some players have a problem with this because they think it takes too much time, and it is indeed a bad idea if pieces are whizzing back and forth in some form of tactical mortal combat where time is more important than life itself. However, most positions don’t exist in this state of frenzy, and building up your game (developing, creating a nice pawn center, putting pressure to bear against weak enemy pawns, etc.) is usually the way to go.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White clearly has a nice attacking position, while Black doesn’t seem to have anything going for him at all (where is his counterplay?). In the actual game, White got a little excited and tried for instant gratification with 1.Bc1 (threatening 2.f5) 1…Rh8 2.Rg4 but after 2…Ng7 Black was holding tight. Instead, he should have improved the position of his Knight, which isn’t helping its teammates on e2. Where should this Knight go? How about e4? That looks like a very nice support point, and from that square it lashes out at d6, f6, and g5 (then any move by the e8-Knight would be crushed by Nf6+). Since we know that the Knight’s position should be improved, and since we know that e4 is the Promised Land, the only question that remains is “how do we get it there?” The answer doesn’t call for any calculation at all: 1.Nc3 with Ne4 to follow. For those wondering what happens if Black whacks the Knight off after <span class="bold">1.Nc3 Bb7 2.Ne4 Bxe4 3.dxe4 Rg8</span>, Black would find himself under serious kingside pressure after <span class="bold">4.f5</span> (made possible by the d3-pawn being moved to e4).</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Chess is a team game. If possible, make sure every piece joins in the battle!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Each piece you own should be treated with parental care. If your Bishop is hitting a brick wall, find (or create) a diagonal for the poor thing! If your Knight is sitting around like a couch potato, drag it to an embattled sector and put the lazy thing to work!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is better for Black, but that assessment might prove somewhat surprising for those players who noticed the active Bishop on e2, the weak doubled-isolated pawn on b5, and white’s central and kingside space advantage. However, Black’s not without his own perks. After all, he does have a queenside spatial plus and white’s pawns on a3 and c2 are both weak and under pressure.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So why doesn’t the black position inspire confidence? The Knight! It’s horrible, and the superiority of white’s Bishop doesn’t seem in question. A look at that Knight might well make us accept this point of view; after all, the Knight’s forcing its Queen to do babysitting duty. And where is the thing going to go? Both a4 and c4 are poison, and blah, that blasted stupid Knight blah, rave, finger wagging, blah! I added the “blahs” since anyone can whine about a problem, but few actually do anything to rectify the situation. It’s clear that the Knight is a goat, but if you’re Black, then it’s <span class="italic">your </span>goat and it’s <span class="italic">your</span> responsibility to improve its lot. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A solution can be found only when you make the psychological transition from “I’m doomed!” to “I <span class="italic">must</span> fix this!” And sure enough, knowing that the Knight has no future on b6 (mixed with a positive mental outlook) makes the solution rather easy to find!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…Nd7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The only Knight-move that doesn’t give away a piece!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The once-shunned Knight is heading for c6 where it will kick white’s Queen and simultaneously create tactical tricks based on …Nb4 (the a3-pawn is pinned). </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">An important nuance that pushes the enemy King into a corner. This means that back rank mate threats appear in some later lines, and in many endgames the King is no longer close to the center.</p>

The rest of the game was marred by time trouble, but the right guy won in the end: <span class="bold">25.Raa1 Rca8 26.Rad1 Rxa3 27.Bxb5 Nb4 28.c4 R8a5 29.f5 exf5 30.g4 Rxb3 31.gxf5 Re3 32.Rb1 Nd3 33.e6 d4 34.Be8 Nc5 35.Bxf7+ Kf8 36.f6 gxf6 37.Rxf6 Ke7 38.Rh6 d3 39.Rxh7 d2 40.Rg1 Re1 41.Bh5+ Kxe6 42.Rg7 Ne4 43.Rg6+ Ke5</span>, 0-1. I was looking at this game with a friend of mine (an IM) and, at this point, he blurted out, “Whose minor piece is better now? Huh? Whose?” The Knight, which once sat on the pathetic b6-square, has made a remarkable metamorphosis.</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">If one of your minor pieces isn’t earning its keep, put the lazy thing to work! In the case of a Knight, wishful thinking won’t get it to that dream post—it’s up to you figure out a way to get it there. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">You should now know Knight-basics, and you should be aware that if your Knight isn’t taking part in the battle, you have to somehow <span class="italic">make </span>it take part! This isn’t easy, but it all starts from the awareness that, 1) There’s a problem; and 2) Once you address the problem, you must <span class="italic">insist</span> on solving it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’re talking about mixing knowledge, a sharp awareness of the imbalances, and willpower to raise your game to a higher level. Our next example (diagram 32) is a nice demonstration of this process: knowledge tells you that Knights are strong on advanced squares (the 5th and 6th ranks being the most desirable). Awareness leads you to the fact that c6 would be a hole if Black no longer had his light-squared Bishop to defend it, and that a Knight on f5 would also be a feather in your cap. Willpower is the thing that allows you to <span class="italic">insist</span> on turning these elements into some form of positive reality.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White has a central pawn majority and the e-pawn gives him a central space advantage. Black’s King isn’t castled yet, which gives White some options that a castled King wouldn’t offer him (for example, Black won’t want to start a fight until he gets his King to safety). Earlier I mentioned the potential hole on c6 and the nice outpost on f5. With all this information in mind, white’s next move should make perfect sense.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.Nd4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White instantly targets both c6 and f5.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">11…Nfxe4? is suicide since this capture opens a road right to the uncastled black King: 12.Nxe4 Bxe4 (12…Nxe4 13.Re1) 13.Bxe4 Nxe4 14.Re1 Nf6 15.Qe2 and the game is already over.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.e5! Bxg2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Perhaps Black should have considered 12…Nd5 though White would then have a few ways to a comfortable edge. The simplest: 13.Nc6 Bxc6 (13…Nxc3?? 14.Nxd8 Nxd1 15.Nxb7 wins) 14.Nxd5 when 14…Bxd5 (14…Bb5!? 15.Re1 Rc8 16.Qg4) 15.Bxd5 gives White two active Bishops in an open position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now, after 12…Bxg2, White gains access to the c6-square.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The c6-Knight paralyzes Black’s whole army. He’s far from dead, but such an unpleasant defensive task is not easy to deal with and Black fell apart very quickly: <span class="bold">16…Kh8? </span>(He could keep his disadvantage to a minimum with 16…Na4 17.Bd2 Bc5) <span class="bold">17.Ba3 f5 18.f4 Rg8 19.Rad1 Bf8 20.Nd8! </span>(A Knight on the 8th! The critters rarely get that far and it’s usually no big deal if they do, but here the double threat of 21.Nf7+ and 21.Qxa8 wins on the spot.)<span class="bold"> 20…Rxd8 21.Qxd8 Qa4 22.Bxc5 Bxc5 23.Qd2 Qe4+ 24.Rf3</span>, 1-0.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I used this position quite often during lessons with various students, explaining the problems Black faces, letting the student try the White side against me, and then me playing it against the student.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One key point is the two holes on f5 and f4. White would love to eventually post a Knight on f5 while Black wouldn’t mind smashing a Knight onto f4. While White has no problem reaching f5 (from e3 or g3), Black can’t get to f4 since both e6 and g6 (the black Knight’s jump-off points) are poison. Of course, White doesn’t have to be in a rush to play Ng3-f5 since that would allow Black to swap it off. Due to this, White will only go there when he can stay—for example, in many endgames where various pieces have been traded, a Knight landing safely on f5 might win one of the pawns on d6 and h6 or, at the very least, force Black to assign those pawns a defender.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">A hole isn’t a problem if the enemy pieces can’t reach it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Other problems Black faces in diagram 33: His dark-squared Bishop is an ugly, ineffective piece. Black has less space in virtually every sector of the board. The only area that can be opened and allow major piece penetration is the queenside, and it’s clear that White already has all the play there.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that White moved his “bad” Bishop to a4 to get it outside the pawn chain. This means that the Bishop will be active on this square or will be exchanged for black’s light-squared Bishop—a Bishop that is one of the defenders of f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since White isn’t worried about …cxb4, he decides to retain the pawn tension and triple on the b-file before opening it.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What does this have to do with Knights? This may shock you, but the mighty steeds you’ve been studying in this chapter also have their own downside (other than being short range pieces, which we’ve already addressed): they can be dominated!

However, the other black Knight on b7 has high hopes of living large on c5. Once there, if White chases it with the b-pawn the Knight could chop on d3 or leap onto a4. Once again, a little pawn will dominate a big, powerful horse via <span class="bold">26.b4!</span> when the once hopeful b7-Knight has no future at all on the queenside (in fact, it eventually migrated to the kingside by …Nb7-d8, …f7-f6, and …Nf7).

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White notices that potential weaknesses lie on b6, c5, and e5. No, c5 isn’t a typo—the seemingly solid c5-pawn can become loose after a well-timed a4-a5 push undermines its defender on b6. Of course, both b6 and e5 might become tender if White could bring pieces to bear on them, but how can this be done?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let me remind you of our earlier philosophical chess thought: <span class="italic">Chess mastery is a mixture of knowledge, awareness, and willpower</span>. This is yet another example of that motto. White knows (i.e., has the knowledge based on often-seen patterns) that this kind of pawn structure can lead to difficulties for Black. He’s aware that the aforementioned pawns could become weak if there was some way to get his pieces within striking range. And finally, he wants to find a maximum piece setup that will accomplish these goals. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So what pieces in the White army will be able to exert pressure against the designated targets? Clearly the Bishop can’t since it’s a light-squared Bishop and the pawns lay on dark squares. The Knight, though, would be a tower of strength on c4 where it would kick the enemy Queen and take direct aim at both b6 and e5. White’s Queen can also join the party on e3 (hitting c5 in anticipation of the a4-a5 break and also giving e4 some support), while placing it on c3 seems even better since it eyes both c5 and e5. That leaves the a4-pawn with its a4-a5 aspirations and the f2-pawn with its dreams of f2-f4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So how can White create such a position? This calls for the step-back boogie!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Nb1!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A shocking move that is very anti-intuitive, but also very logical. The Knight returns to its beginning square because it just wasn’t happy on c3! Remember that a piece is only happy if it’s on a square where it helps with the overall game plan. In this case the c3-Knight might look okay on c3, but it’s not addressing all the issues that were discussed earlier. However, wouldn’t it be a killer on c4? And suddenly one sees that this odd retreat ties everything together: c3 is now clear for white’s Queen while the Knight will head for c4 via a3 or d2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…Qf6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This allows White to make his vision a reality. Instead, moves such as 16…Bd7 or 16…Bb7 would limit white’s advantage. Another possibility is 16…Nf6 when aside from 17.Qe3, interesting is 17.Na3!? Nxe4 18.Qe3 Nf6 19.Nc4 Nxd5 20.Nxd6 Nxe3 21.Nxc8 Nxc2 22.Nxb6 Ra7 23.a5 with a pleasant edge for White (Black, after he chops one of the Rooks, has a Rook and two pawns for two minor pieces, but the two minors will be very nicely placed while the pawns on a6 and c5 will prove to be extremely weak).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">17.Qc3 Nd6 18.Nd2 e6 </span>and now <span class="bold">19.a5! </span>(instead of my lazy 19.Bf1—I played a4-a5 a move later) would have been thematic, destroying black’s queenside pawn chain at the base and gaining a clear advantage.</p>
