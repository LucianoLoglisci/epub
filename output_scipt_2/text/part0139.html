			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Throughout this book, I’ve blended most pawn structure themes in with other subjects (weak pawns, space, etc.), but after a lot of thought I decided to give passed pawns their own section. My reasons for doing so:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn can be a static powerhouse and/or a dynamic game winner. Thus understanding it will also improve your understanding of statics and dynamics.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn discourse is the ideal training ground for the concept of blockade.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A pawn majority’s ultimate goal is the creation of a passed pawn. Thus, understanding passed pawns vastly increases your understanding of pawn majorities. </p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A passed pawn, even a protected passed pawn, can often turn out to be a serious disadvantage. This shocking fact alone warrants the creation of this section! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Whether you refer to it as a “passed pawn,” a “passer,” a “passed banana” (a favorite among players in Denver), a “baby Queen,” a “posing Polly” (a passed pawn that just sits there, looking good but doing nothing), or (in the case of a fast-moving passed pawn) a “nimble Louie,” this particular kind of pawn has captured the imagination and respect of amateurs everywhere. A protected passed pawn is given even more reverence since nothing can hurt it, and at any moment it might rocket to the eighth rank (“nimble Louie!”) and (if the pawn is owned by the opponent) turn into something unpleasant. In this chapter we’re going to stare in awe at an unstoppable passer, while also demonstrating how nimble Louie’s sprinting abilities can be forestalled by a blockade. Yes, a passed pawn can and often does invade the end zone and make a touchdown, but it can just as easily find itself glued to a square, unable to move or influence the game in any meaningful way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The material in this section will make your view of passed pawns more realistic, and give you the ability to decide when a passer is gold, and when it’s nothing more than gaud.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-115" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-11"/>Creation</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The most common way for a passed pawn to be “born” is via a pawn majority. Here’s a clear example of a pawn majority’s power:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black appears to be fine, but he’s actually hopelessly lost! Why? Because White has a healthy kingside pawn majority while Black’s queenside majority is crippled. Of course, that alone won’t be decisive since black’s Queen is very actively placed. However, White realizes that he can force the trade of all black’s pieces, leaving him with a dead won King and pawn endgame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rxf7 Rxf7</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">1…Qd4+ 2.R7f2 leaves White with an extra Rook.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2.Rxf7 Kxf7 3.Qc4+! Qxc4 4.dxc4 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Things are now clear: White can easily make a passed pawn by advancing his kingside pawns, while Black can’t create a passer on the other side because his majority is diseased—if Black tries …c6 followed by …b5, White responds with b2-b3 when black’s hopes are crushed since …b5-b4 is a dead end street, and taking on a4 or c4 also leaves him with nothing after White recaptures.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Kh2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s King can endlessly move between h2 and g2 until Black runs out of pawn moves. Then his King will have to leave h4, thereby allowing white’s majority to start its march after Kg3, h3-h4, etc.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…g6 11.Kg2 Kg5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">11…g5 leads to the same kind of end as that in the note to black’s 9th move.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.Kg3 Kf6 13.h4 Kg7 14.Kf4 Kf6 15.h5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We finally see the birth of a passed pawn!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…g5+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s more or less the same thing after 15…gxh5 16.gxh5 Kg7 17.Kg5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Ke4 Ke6 17.h6 Kf6 18.h7 Kg7 19.Kf5 Kxh7 20.Kxg5 Kg7 21.Kf5 Kf7 22.g5 Kg7 23.g6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White could also win by Ke6 when all of black’s queenside pawns will be devoured.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Kg8 24.Kf6 Kf8 25.g7+ Kg8 26.Kg6 b5 27.axb5 cxb5 28.cxb5 c4 29.b6 c3 30.b7 c2 31.b8=Q </span>mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that a pawn majority can be a huge static plus since it can sit quietly for ages, apparently doing nothing. Then, in the blink of an eye, it can rush forward and give birth to a Queen. However, a pawn majority can also be a dynamic powerhouse, mixing the creation of a passed pawn with some seriously nasty space gaining boa action.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White managed to survive some terrible opening play and can now can sit back and celebrate his new lease on life—there are no more serious enemy threats to fear and his passed d-pawn is a definite asset. Surprisingly for a player of Leonhardt’s class, Black makes two poor moves in a row, allowing White to take over the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Bxb3?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black should retain this Bishop since it keeps an eye on the d5-pawn’s path through d7. With all the minor pieces off, Black can only blockade with a Queen or Rook, and neither of those powerful pieces really wants to be employed as a babysitter. In fact, this mistake allows me to present a highly useful rule [sidebar]:</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">The ideal plan for a player with an advanced passed pawn is to exchange all the minor pieces, leaving both sides with a Queen and Rook(s) vs. Queen and Rook(s). This creates possibilities of obtaining the kind of advantageous Queen endgames discussed earlier, and also makes the blockade of the passer uncomfortable. Note that the Queens should be retained, since that piece’s power makes the defending King’s participation in the defense rather risky.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Better was 25…b6, taking the c5-square away from the Knight. Other moves that could have also been considered were 25…Qb4!? and 25…Re4 26.Re2 Bxb3 27.axb3 Rd4, though the endgame should be drawn after 28.Re8+ Kh7 29.Qb1+ Qd3 (29…g6 30.Re7) 30.Qxd3+ Rxd3 31.Rb8. In all these cases, Black would have retained some slight pressure on white’s position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.axb3 Rd8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">With his last two moves, Black has allowed White to realize the rule calling for the creation of a Queen and Rook vs. Queen and Rook situation. Much better was 26…Qe5! 27.d6 Qe1+ 28.Qxe1 Rxe1+ 29.Kh2 Re8 when, with the Queens off, black’s King can safely enter the fray—if it can reach d7, the black King would not only blockade the pawn, but would also begin the process of attacking and winning it! Of course, White has various tries after 29…Re8 that will try to take advantage of black’s present passivity (a well-timed Rd2-c2-c7 is one, while g4, Kg3, and f2-f4-f5 grabs a serious amount of space). But accurate defense should easily give Black the half point.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Black, who is a pawn ahead, thinks he can brag about his two kingside passed pawns. Not only that, but the passed g-pawn is also attacking white’s Rook and threatens to turn into a Queen. However, all that melodrama is meaningless here, as are both of black’s kingside pawns.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The position looks very promising for White. His pieces are more active than black’s and his pawns are healthier and far more dynamic. In fact, an eventual f4-f5 push will not only allow White to strive for a far advanced passed pawn by e5-e6, but it will also create serious kingside angst by the threat of f5-f6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…f5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black, by force, turns white’s central pawn majority into a protected passed e-pawn. But wasn’t it the dream of the pawn majority to become a passed pawn? Therefore, does black’s 18…f5 make any sense at all? Actually, it does! By giving White a protected passed pawn, he ends all the dynamic potential of white’s former pawn majority. Gone is the space guzzling threat of f4-f5, gone is the kingside smash of an eventual f4-f5-f6. All that remains is white’s passed e-pawn.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">It’s official: the e5-pawn is a Posing Polly! But isn’t it still useful as endgame insurance? In fact, black’s doubled majority <span class="italic">has</span> to be inferior to the mighty passed pawn! Right? Nope. There are three reasons for this:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The e5-pawn is acting as a traitor to white’s army! That’s right, a traitor! First off, it blocks the d4-Bishop. Second, it stops up the e5-square (which white’s Bishop and Knight might like to use if it was open). Finally, it blocks the e-file which, in turn, lets Black comfortably stick a minor piece on e6 (White Rooks doubled on the e-file would pressure a piece there, but now e6 is rock solid).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s queenside majority, though devalued due to the doubled c-pawns, is still mobile and active (after an eventual …b6 followed by …c5 they will control key squares and gain queenside space). On the other hand, white’s e-pawn has no dynamic plusses at all.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>We still have to address where each side will play on. Black’s queenside majority (after …b6 and …c5) will give him a comfortable game on the queenside. The center, with the exception of the d-file which both sides can make use of, is blocked. The kingside offers White nothing at all.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Once you take all this in, you will come to realize that White has no real advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.b3 Rad8 21.c4 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">31.Nd5 appears tempting, but after 31…Bxd5 32.cxd5 Kf7 the d5-pawn will be hard to defend. One problem is that the d2-Bishop is tied down to the defense of f4. The other is that …Ne7 will turn the impressive looking white center into a juicy target. For example: 33.g3 (33.g4 Ne7! and 33.e6+ Ke8 are also bad for White) 33…Ne7 34.d6 cxd6 35.exd6 Nd5 followed by …Ke6 and …Kxd6.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s protected passed pawn is frozen in place by the fine blockading black Knight. What else does White have to crow about? Nothing—the queenside and kingside are locked up and the only open file is, at the moment, controlled by Black. Thus, White doesn’t have anything in this position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, if we were to remove the traitorous e5-pawn (just take it off and toss it into the box!) then White wins immediately since all his pieces spring to life: his tripled heavy pieces nuke the e-file, his Bishop ravages the a1-h8 diagonal, and his Knight can leap into e5 if the situation demands it. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Sadly for White, the e5-pawn must remain on the board (I suppose you could offer the pawn to your opponent: “I’ll give you my e-pawn. Seriously! I’ll just take it off the board and hand it to you!”), which means that all of white’s pieces are misplaced due to their hitting the e5-brick.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since Black intends to double up on the d-file, White would be advised to initiate some exchanges and agree to a quick draw after <span class="bold">1.Rd1 Rxd1 2.Qxd1 Rd8 3.Rd3 Rxd3 4.Qxd3 Qd8</span>, =.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has firmly and permanently blocked white’s passed d-pawn, and his d6-Knight should, according to our discussions about blockade, be viewed as a genuine hero. It all sounds so nice, yet it’s all so very, very wrong! The problem is that Black has no counterplay, which means that he has to quietly wait around and hope that White can’t find a way to break into his position. Though a passively placed player can draw from time to time, one usually cracks in the face of the opponent’s relentless pressure.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">26.Rc2 </span>(Since Black can’t do anything, White can quietly and safely set up his ideal attacking position before nuking the kingside.) <span class="bold">26…Ra8 27.b3 Rf7 28.Rg2 Kh8 29.Kh2 Nf8 30.Qh4 h6 31.Rfg1 Nh7 32.Rg6 Raf8 33.Qg4 Ng5 34.h4 Qd8 </span>(Giving up, but he was also dead after 34…Nh7 35.Bxh6 Ne8 36.Be3 followed by h4-h5-h6)<span class="bold"> 35.hxg5 hxg5 36.Kg2 Kg8 37.Rh1 Re8 38.Qh5</span>, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, the same idea of “having no play” needs to be applied to the side with the passed pawn—if the passed pawn is firmly blocked and the blockading side has all the remaining play, then the blockader gets to have all the fun.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This might seem to be good for White—he has permanent pressure against b6 and e5, and his passed d-pawn, though blockaded, might act as endgame insurance in the future. However, Bronstein had a different way of looking at this position—he realized that, once he gave backup to both b6 and e5, thus making them invulnerable, White would suddenly find himself without any play at all. In that case, a pawn advance on the kingside (where he already holds a clear spatial advantage) would sweep the white King away.</p>
