			<p class="caption2"><span class="bold"><a id="H.-Staunton---J.-Loewenthal--Birmingham-1858"/>H. Staunton - J. Loewenthal, Birmingham 1858<br class="calibre3"/></span>White to move</p>
			<p class="caption4">In this position White tried 15.Bxc6 Bxc6 16.e4, giving Black the two Bishops but closing the game so they would be ineffective. Was this a wise decision?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.c4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.e3 Bb4 4.Qb3 c5 5.Nd5 Nc6 6.Ne2 d6 7.Ng3 Be6 8.a3 Ba5 9.Qxb7 Bd7 10.Qb3 0–0 11.Nxf6+ Qxf6 12.Be2 Qh4 13.Bf3 Rab8 14.Qd3 Bc7 - </span>Diagram 96</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s a pawn up, but Black has a lead in development and would have enjoyed good compensation after the pedestrian 15.0-0 f5 16.Bd5+ Kh8. However, here Staunton had a sudden inspiration—why not add a superior minor piece to his extra pawn? And so the sequence <span class="bold">15.Bxc6 Bxc6 16.e4</span> came into existence. This would be great if White had the time to play 0-0, Qe2, d3, and f2-f4. However, Black isn’t going to sit back and accept a closed position and inferior Bishops.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Another hard problem. I think players under Expert would have trouble evaluating things. After all, Black’s down a pawn and it does indeed look like black’s Bishops are dead in the water. To get beyond some easy misconceptions in this position, one needs a solid grasp of Statics vs. Dynamics (explored in detail in Part Six), and an advanced eye for tactics.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…f5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This rips open the position and, in doing so, shatters white’s illusions. The lesson here is clear: if you are going to give your opponent two Bishops, be absolutely certain that he can’t open things up!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Conversely, if you have the two Bishops and they seem dead, <span class="italic">insist</span> on finding a way to bring them to life! The concept of mental toughness (pushing your own agenda) can be found in Part Four.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.0–0 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is not what White wanted to play, but he suddenly realized that 17.Nxf5 failed to 17...Bxe4 18.Nxh4 (18.Qg3 Qxg3 19.Nxg3 Bxg2 20.Rg1 Bc6 followed by 21...Rf3 is crushing since finding any reasonable moves for White will prove more than a little difficult) 18...Bxd3 when white’s position is hopelessly lost. Notice how black’s light-squared Bishop puts the Knight to shame.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, trying to hunker down with 17.f3 loses a piece to 17…f4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17…fxe4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This simple capture leaves Black with a clear advantage. Material is now even, but all of the black pieces are superior to their white counterparts. Loewenthal managed to eventually win, though he seemed to try hard to botch it:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Qc2 Rf4 19.b3 Rbf8 20.Bb2 R8f6 21.Rae1 Rh6 22.h3 Rhf6 </span>(22…e3! with the idea of …Bxg2 would have been very strong)<span class="bold"> 23.Re3 Ba5 24.Qd1 Qh6 25.Qe2 Qg6 26.Bc1 Rh4 27.Re1 Rff4 28.Nf1 Rf3 29.Ng3 Rxe3 30.Qxe3 Qf7 31.Re2 Rf4 32.Bb2 Qg6 33.b4 Bb6 34.b5 Bb7 35.Qc3 h5 36.Re3 h4 37.Nh1 Qf7 38.a4 Qc7 39.d3 Ba5 40.Qc2 exd3 41.Qxd3 e4 42.Qd1 Qe7 43.g3 hxg3 44.Rxg3 Rf7 45.Re3 d5 46.cxd5 Qg5+ 47.Ng3 Bxd5 48.Bc1 Qe5 49.Qc2 c4 50.Bb2 Qg5 51.Bd4 Bb6 52.Qd2 Qf4 53.Nh5 c3 54.Bxc3 Qg5+ 55.Ng3 Bxe3 56.Qxe3 Qxe3 57.fxe3 Rf3 58.Be5 Rxe3 59.Nf5 Rd3 60.a5 e3 61.Nd4 Rd1+ 62.Kh2 e2 63.Nxe2 Rd2 64.Bb8 Rxe2+ 65.Kg3 Rb2</span>, 0-1.</p>
