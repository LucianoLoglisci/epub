			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The ability to laugh at your opponent’s threats while also seeking the very best for your own position is a huge one.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>You will gain huge dividends by creating an “I’ll do what I want no matter what you say” attitude in chess.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If your opponent sends you a subliminal “you have to” command, challenge it and let him know that the only agenda that’s going to be pushed is yours.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Instead of the word <span class="italic">initiative</span>, which few really understand, I use terms such as “macho chess”, “pushing one’s own agenda”, “rubbish”, “I will find a way”, I must”, and “I’ll do what I want no matter what you say” to illustrate and teach.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>I consider the initiative to be a physical manifestation of a psychological battle; both sides champion their view of things in the hope that the opponent will have to eventually forgo his own plans and react to yours. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>You can train yourself to fully understand and use these concepts by studying grandmaster games and getting a feel for the way the chess gods always stress the positive aspects of their game, and/or you can (and should!) practice this in your own games (tournament or blitz!), making sure that every game you play is a live lesson in positive cues like “Rubbish!” “I must find the best move!” “I will make full use of the positive imbalances in my position!” “I’ll do what I want to!” and other nuggets of that nature. Yes, it <span class="italic">will</span> go horribly wrong from time to time, but that’s how you learn. When you get nuked (which is inevitable—it happens to everybody), get up, wipe away the radioactive dust, and try again and again and again.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A key position is, in my view, a very personal thing—while one player might see a particular situation as a key position that demands a huge effort to solve, another will see the same position as easy and thus not important at all. A position is only “key” if you sense that the correct move or plan will have a major impact on the game, but the right move or plan isn’t clear to you.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The terms, “lazy move”, “soft move”, and “half move” all describe a move that doesn’t do as much as it should. </p>
