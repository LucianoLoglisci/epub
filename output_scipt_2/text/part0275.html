			<p class="caption4">The Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez gives White the superior pawn structure (a healthy pawn majority versus a crippled one), but in return Black gets two Bishops and potential pressure down the e-file against white’s e-pawn. In the present situation, Black can also play with the idea of …f6-f5, opening the position up even further for his Bishops. How should White handle this position?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0–0 Bd6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 f6 8.b3 Ne7 9.h3 Ng6 10.Ba3 Nh4 11.Qe3 Nxf3+ 12.Qxf3 0–0</span> - Diagram 409</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though White usually tries to get mileage from his healthy majority, there’s just no way to get even a drop of honey from that kind of plan since Black is not only solid, but also has active shots like …f6-f5. Because of this, White has to eschew his usual ideas and try and create a situation where he will be able to put a bit of pressure on the enemy position. To accomplish this, he needs to change the pawn structure so that Black will have a target that can be reached, and pressured, by white’s army. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The answer to these ruminations is 13.Rd1 followed by 14.Bxd6, undoubling black’s pawns and also ending any talk of a pawn majority for White! It seems anti-intuitive—in fact, does it even make sense? Yes it does! White’s logic, in a nutshell, is that it’s better to have a target one can reach and attack than a “someday I’ll be able to use it” static plus that doesn’t offer active play or a clear plan.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This one’s tough because a player often falls in love with whatever positive imbalance he has and fails to notice that it doesn’t allow him a way to get anything from it. To make matters worse, the idea of undoubling the opponent’s pawns is unthinkable! It’s something most players would reject out of hand.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">13.Rd1! Qe7 14.Bxd6 cxd6 15.Qd3 Rd8 16.c4</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Things have drastically changed! Suddenly White has a central space advantage and obvious pressure against the d6-pawn. Now White knows exactly what to do (if Black sits around, then Nc3, Rd2 and Rad1 would increase black’s woes), while simultaneously limiting black’s active aspirations due to his being tied down to the defense of d6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game sees White clinging to a small edge while he relentlessly strives to increase the pressure against d6: <span class="bold">16…Be6 17.Nc3 b5 18.Ne2 bxc4 19.bxc4 Qf7 20.Rac1 c5 21.Nf4 Rab8 22.Qc3 Rb4 23.Nd5 Bxd5 24.Rxd5 Qb7 25.Qd3 Rb8 26.Rxd6 Rb1 27.Rf1 Rxf1+ 28.Kxf1 Qb1+ 29.Qxb1 Rxb1+ 30.Ke2 Rc1? </span>(30…Rb2+!) <span class="bold">31.Rxa6 Rxc4 32.Ke3 Rc2 33.a4 Rc3+ 34.Kd2 Ra3 35.f4 h5 36.a5 Ra4 37.Kd3 Ra3+ 38.Kc4 Ra4+ 39.Kxc5 Rxe4 40.Rc6 Rxf4 41.a6 Ra4 42.Kb6 Kh7 43.a7 Kg6 44.Rc5</span>, 1-0.</p>
