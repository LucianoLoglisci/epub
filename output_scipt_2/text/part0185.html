			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is from the game <a id="girl-brain---Brooklyn--ICC-2007"/>girl-brain - Brooklyn, ICC 2007. White wasn’t sure what to do and, accordingly, played a move (1.Bc3?) that actually hindered her proper plan. The key here is being aware of the holes on d4 and d5. Black needs to get a Knight to d4 as quickly as possible, and White needs to get a Knight to d5 at warp speed. Once you realize where your pieces should go, it becomes easy to find the correct moves to make it happen. However, if you are just mindlessly calculating moves with no real plan in mind, then you’ll usually play something that has little or nothing to do with the needs of the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the diagram, White would love to play Nd2-b1-c3-d5. However, moving the d2-Knight would result in the loss of the e4-pawn. Thus, defend the pawn!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I would hope that players in the 1400 to 1800 range would recognize a huge hole and try to get their Knight to it. However, in this case e4 is weak, so this process calls for some patience. As a result, I upped the difficulty level to 1600.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rfe1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Defending e4 and thus freeing the d2-Knight of guard duty.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As mentioned earlier, in the actual game White played the nonsensical 1.Bc3?, taking the c3-square away from the Knight. The continuation (which doesn’t boast ideal play for either side) was: 1…Rfd8 2.Rfd1 Ne8 3.Nf1 (Finally noticing that d5 would make a nice home for her Knight! Fortunately, in this case all roads lead to Rome.) 3…f6 4.Ne3 Qb8 5.Nd5 (White’s doing well) 5…Bf8 6.Rd2 (6.Bh3 was very strong) 6…Nc7 7.Rad1? (Literally ignoring black’s idea—if you refuse to take your opponent’s plans into consideration, you are dooming yourself to a lot of pain. Instead of 7.Rad1, simply 7.Bh3, stopping …Ne6 in its tracks, would have given White a very large advantage.) 7…Ne6 8.Nh4 Nd4 and though White still has a slight plus, black’s chances have significantly improved. Also note how useless white’s idea of doubling on the d-file has turned out to be.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…a6 2.a4 axb5 3.axb5 Ra8 4.Rxa8 Rxa8 5.Nb1! </span>followed by Nc3-d5 with a solid plus.</p>
