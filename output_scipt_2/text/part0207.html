			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is pleasant for White thanks to her pair of Bishops and the misplaced Knight on h5. Neither side has any serious weaknesses though, so there’s no need for over-optimism from white’s side or panic from black’s. In general, there are two ways for the inferior side (in this case, Black) to play in such situations: one is to accept that you’re worse and just improve your game bit by bit in an effort to steer the position to eventual equality and a draw. The other is to seek tactical chances, remembering that you can’t force such things since overaggressive moves tend to create self-inflicted weaknesses and can make things worse. In the present case Black should carefully weigh both. The thematic “go for it” idea is 26…f5 (trying to get the b7-Bishop into the action), but 27.Rxc8 Rxc8 28.Bh3 Nf6 29.Re1 leaves Black under serious pressure.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Assessments should all be in the “favorable to White because of her two Bishops” box, but after that there’s lots of nuance and wiggle room.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since 26…f5 didn’t get the job done, Black should tighten up her position first. Perhaps a chance for …f7-f5 will appear later, perhaps not. But there’s no shame in being realistic and accepting that the opponent’s two Bishops are better than your Bishop and Knight. Once you make this sober determination, you should seek the usual anti-Bishop pair ideas (try to exchange one of the Bishops), get all your pieces into play, and create a solid “wall” that’s devoid of weak points. For example: 26…Nf6 (Don’t allow your Knight to rot away on the side of the board!) 27.Rxc8 (27.a4!?) 27…Rxc8 28.Rc1 Rxc1 29.Qxc1 Nfe8 with a solid but slightly inferior game. Okay, you might be scared to death if you were facing Kramnik here, but do you really believe that your non-Kramnik opponent has the technique to eviscerate such a position? After 30.Qc3 (30.Qc2 would stop any …f5 nonsense—white’s better, so why should she allow things to get out of control?) 30…f5! (Black has the usual array of “hold on tight” moves, but this move now seems rather interesting) 31.Bh3 Qf6 32.Qb3+ Kf8 and who knows what might happen?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In the actual game, Black lashed out.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…g5?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The idea is to crack e4 with …g5-g4. However, the poor placement of the h5-Knight and the fear that a further opening up of the position will favor the Bishops (which it usually does!) makes the push of the g-pawn rather dubious.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Again: Unless you’re sure that an aggressive/committal idea will bear fruit, don’t embark on an adventure that will only add to your defensive chore by creating new weaknesses in your own camp!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Nc4 Nxc4 28.Rxd8+ Rxd8 29.Bxc4 Qf6 30.Be2 Rd7 31.Qb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A nice move that threatens 32.Qa4, simultaneously hitting d7 and a7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">31…a6 32.b5 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Excellent play by Miss Krush (chess player names don’t get any better than Krush)! By freezing the b6-pawn, it becomes a “diagonal casualty”—how can Black guard it after Bf2 followed by Qe3?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">32…a5 33.Rd1 Rd6 34.Bf2! g4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">At this point, Black has every right to panic!</p>

The resulting endgame offers Black no hope at all. The rest of the game was more execution than battle:<span class="bold"> 41.Qxg6+ fxg6 42.b6 Bb7 43.Be3 Nf7 44.Bd2 a4 45.Bb5 Kg7 46.Bxa4 Nd6 47.Bb3 g5 48.a4 Kf6 49.a5 e4 50.Bc3+ Ke7 51.Bb4 e3 52.Bc4 Kd7 53.Bxd6 Kxd6 54.Be2 Be4 55.a6 Kc6 56.b7 Kc7 57.Kf1 Kb8 58.Ke1 Bc2 59.Bc4</span>, 1-0.</p>
