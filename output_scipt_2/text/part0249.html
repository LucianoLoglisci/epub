			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Nd5 Nxd5 8.exd5 Nb8 9.c4 Be7 10.Bd3 a6 11.Nc3 O-O 12.O-O f5 13.f3 Nd7 14.Kh1 Bg5 15.b4 b6 16.a3 Kh8 17.Qc2 Qf6 18.g4 Bxc1 19.Raxc1</span> - Diagram 269</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s g2-g4 was a bold and greedy move designed to lay claim to the e4-square. Thus, moves such as 19…fxg4 and 19…f4 would give White exactly what he wants. However, Black has no intention of caving to his opponent’s demands. So, instead of giving White a square, he lashes out and annexes one for himself!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Another problem, another example of creating a weakness rather than hoping that one will appear. I start the level at 1800 since white’s 18.g4 could easily strike fear into the hearts of many players, and the solution seems odd since it opens the f-file so the f1-Rook gets a birds eye view of black’s Queen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…e4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White targeted a square and Black does the same thing! As I said earlier, weak squares usually don’t just magically appear—a player has to create them. And, if it costs a pawn to do so, it’s a small price to pay for winning the strategic battle.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.fxe4 f4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has a clear advantage. Why? Black’s Knight will dominate the board from the juicy hole on e5, white’s kingside is open and vulnerable, and the f4-pawn will prove to be a very active participant in the coming battle. Note that white’s extra pawn (on e4) actually blocks its own pieces—the c3-Knight can’t live on e4 anymore, and the d3-Bishop is locked in by the c4 and e4 pawns. The rest of the game was one-sided: <span class="bold">21.Ne2 f3 22.Qd2 Ne5 23.g5 Qg6 24.Ng1 Bg4 25.Bb1 Rf7 26.c5 bxc5 27.bxc5 dxc5 28.h3 Raf8 29.Rf2 Qh5 30.Qc3 Bxh3 31.Nxh3 Ng4 32.Rh2 Nxh2 33.Kxh2 f2 34.Bd3 Rf3 35.Bf1 Rxc3 36.Rxc3 Qd1 37.Kg2 Qg4+ 38.Kh2 Qxe4 39.Rxc5 Qd4 40.Rc6</span>, 0-1.</p>
