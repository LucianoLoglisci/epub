			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’m going to do something different in this group of problems. If a problem presupposes that the position arrives from an opening you know, I’ll list the basic imbalance schema (to create an artificial “I know what’s going on here!” mindset) and then pose a specific question. If a problem presupposes that the position arrives from an opening you know nothing about, I’ll simply give you a specific question.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">The following tests are designed to give you insight into how much you’ve learned <span class="italic">and</span> to serve as extra instruction. If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
