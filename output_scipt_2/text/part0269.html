			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has a protected passed d-pawn, but it’s firmly blocked by the d3-Bishop. On the other hand, a Bishop isn’t the best of blockaders—note how the d3-Bishop looks more like a Tall-Pawn than a Bishop. Clearly, while a Knight can block a pawn <span class="italic">and</span> show great activity from the blockading square, a Bishop can easily find itself in a purely defensive posture when holding back an enemy passer.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though White doesn’t have a passed pawn of his own, he does have a very mobile queenside pawn majority. Indeed, after a4-a5 Black will have to constantly worry about the further expansion of white’s queenside pawns.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: We’ve looked at this kind of thing in the Passed Pawn section, but that doesn’t make black’s correct move any less difficult to come to terms with. Quite simply, it’s something most players just can’t bring themselves to do!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…a5</span><span class="bold">! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is handed a protected passed pawn on a silver platter, yet Black is more than glad to do so. Why? Because once he places his Knight on b6, the pawn is going nowhere while the pawns on a4 and c4 will require constant defense. After that Black can (and will) play for the strong break ...f7-f5. Remember that it’s not enough to have a firm blockade, you also need active play elsewhere on the board.</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black’s Knight is a better blockader than white’s Bishop</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black has an excellent position thanks to the fact that his blockading piece stops the pawn and hits a4 and c4. Compare that with white’s, which blocks d4 and defends c4, but plays no active role. Black now prepares …f7-f5, which will give him chances for a kingside attack (if the f-pawn is allowed to continue on to f4) and central domination if White captures on f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game has some inaccuracies, but it still gives us a clear look into the strength of a mobile pawn majority—in this case Black gets a central pawn majority and shoves it down white’s throat: <span class="bold">20.Rc1 Qc7 21.Qe2 f6 22.Nf1 g6 23.Nd2 f5 24.exf5 gxf5 25.f3 Re7 26.Re1 Bd7 27.Qd1 Nc8 28.Qb1 Nd6 29.Nf1 Rf8 30.Ra2 e4 31.fxe4 fxe4 32.Bxe4 Rxe4 33.Rxe4 Bf5 34.Ng3 Nxe4 35.Nxe4 Qf4</span>, 0-1.</p>
