			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This game mixes positional power grabs and a striving for controlled dynamics with detailed tactics. For example, seeing 13…b5 without understanding what must follow isn’t good enough. In other words, it’s advanced (but highly instructive) stuff.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The late Tony Miles was a far better player than I ever was, but that’s no excuse for the horrible psychological dive I made in this game. When entering the position in diagram 197, I had intended to play 13…b5! 14.a4 Nc5!? 15.Nd2 (15.bxc4 bxc4 16.0-0 Ne4 17.Qa5 Qd8 favors Black) 15…Bf5 16.axb5 Nd3+ 17.Bxd3 Bxd3 18.bxc4 dxc4, but then I got spooked by 19.f3 when white’s King will sit comfortably on f2 (I wasn’t worried about 19.Nxc4 Qg6). I immediately suffered through an emotional crash, thinking that all my calculations were garbage. I suddenly lost faith in myself; after all, I was playing Miles and he had undoubtedly seen and rejected my whole line. Filled with self-loathing, I raised the flag of positional surrender with 13…cxb3? and died like a coward with no play and no hope: 14.Qxb3 (Black has a passive game due to his three pawn islands—b7 and d5 are under pressure, a3-a4-a5 will chase black’s Knight if it moves to b6, and 0-0 followed by Rfc1 can easily lead to White penetrating down the c-file.) 14…Qd6 15.Qb4 Qb8 16.0–0 Nf6 17.Rfc1 Bg4 18.Rab1 Bf5 19.Rb3 Rc8 20.Rxc8+ Bxc8 21.Qe7 Bd7 22.Ne5 Qe8 23.Qxe8+ Bxe8 24.Rxb7 Rc8 25.f3 a5 26.Bb5 Rc3 27.a4 Rxe3 28.Ra7 Bxb5 29.axb5 Ra3 30.b6 Rb3 31.b7 Kh7 32.Nc6 Nd7 33.Nxa5 Rb4 34.Ra8 Rb5 35.Rd8 Rxa5 36.Rxd7 Rb5 37.Rxf7 Kg6 38.Rc7 Kf6 39.h4, 1-0. After the game I showed him my intended variation (13…b5 14.a4 Nc5) up to 19.f3. He said, “I didn’t see any of that!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I was guilty of a number of crimes:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>I bowed to “I can’t.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>I irrationally feared the “all seeing eye” of the superior opponent.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Once I noticed something that hadn’t occurred to me, I immediately gave up on my variation. Remember: if you don’t defend your analysis, who will?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The fact is that the unimaginative (lazy) 13…cxb3 is just a bad move. Rather than accept a passive position with long-term positional woes, it was my job to wave my fist at the “easy way out” and demand more from myself—I needed to make my original intention work since it offered active pieces and a somewhat unstable white King for me to gnaw on.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Such “key” moments occur often, and find you balancing between heroism and doubt. The lines you might look at don’t need to be complicated, but they <span class="italic">do</span> need a confident general to make them work.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As it turned out, my intended variation was fully playable: 13…b5! 14.a4 Nc5!? 15.Nd2 Bf5 16.axb5 Nd3+ 17.Bxd3 Bxd3 18.bxc4 dxc4 19.f3 and now 19…a6! offers Black enough counterplay: 20.b6 (20.bxa6 Rxa6 21.Rxa6 Qxa6 22.Kf2 Ra8 23.Rc1 Qa2 23.Kg3 Ra3 25.Qb4 Ra4 with a draw) 20…Qxb6 21.Kf2 Rfc8, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, let’s say that 19.f3 did favor White. Is that the end of the story? Perhaps, perhaps not. The only way to know for sure is to look for earlier improvements after the combative <span class="bold">13…b5 14.a4</span>. I didn’t do this and got what I deserved. But if I had looked at that position with a confident eye, I would have noticed that there was a whole world that I was missing:</p>
