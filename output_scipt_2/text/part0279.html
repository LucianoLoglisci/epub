			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5 4.dxc5 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bb5 e6 7.Bxc6+ bxc6 8.b4 a5 9.c3 axb4 10.cxb4 Qb8 11.Qd4</span> - Diagram 413</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though it looks chaotic, things are actually pretty straightforward. White has an extra pawn (a static plus) while Black enjoys active pieces and pressure against a2, b4, and e5 (his position is driven by dynamics).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White would love to castle, develop his forces, give e5 firm support, and then either go for active queenside play with a2-a4 followed by an eventual b4-b5, or simply solidify his pawn structure with a2-a3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black, who is a pawn down, has to turn the game into a fistfight. Time is of the essence, and Black needs to keep White off balance by creating threats against the aforementioned pawn weaknesses on a2, b4, and e5. After he deals with his attacked g4-Bishop, moves such as …Ng8-e7-f5 and/or …Ra8-a4 will follow, increasing the pressure on white’s position.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you noted that Black is down a pawn and needs to play actively, and if you noticed that the g4-Bishop is hanging, and if you saw that 11…Bxf3 not only gains time but also ruins white’s pawn structure and gives the black Knight a wonderful hole to leap to on f5, then you’ve done very well.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In the actual game, Black played the hideous 11…Bh5?, literally handing White a free move. When I asked about this, Black told me, “I retained my Bishop because I wanted it to keep control of the light-squares.” Thinking like that can pay dividends in a different kind of position, but when dynamics are your life-blood, a more energetic treatment is called for. Correct was: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11…Bxf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Obvious and strong. Since the e5-pawn is a target, why not chop off its main defender while simultaneously destroying white’s kingside pawn structure?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Less logical is 11. … Ra4 12.Qxg4 Rxb4 13.Qg3 Rxb1 14.Rxb1 Qxb1 15.0–0 Qxa2 16.Nd4 when Black is suddenly the one with the extra pawn, but White’s safe King and obvious lead in development gives him good dynamic compensation (complete role reversal!).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.gxf3 Ne7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The hole on f5 is an ideal home for black’s Knight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.f4 Nf5 14.Qc3 g5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I mentioned energy, and this certainly fits the bill! This move strives to tear down e5 and, in many lines, open the g-file for the h8-Rook.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The calmer 14…Be7 15.a3 Qb5 16.Nd2 0-0 offers Black solid compensation for the pawn sacrifice, but 14…g5 is more in the spirit of the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">15.Nd2 Ra4 16.a3 gxf4 17.Nf3 Rg8 18.Bxf4 Rg4 19.Be3 Qb5</span> and Black’s pieces are all over his beleaguered opponent. One possible variation: <span class="bold">20.Kd2 Rc4 21.Qd3 Nxe3 22.fxe3 Bxc5 23.Rhb1 Be7 24.Nd4 Qb8 25.Qxh7 Qxe5 26.Qg8+ Kd7 27.Qxf7 Ra8!</span> with a winning attack.</p>
