			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Handing Black a chance for counterplay that he never should have been given. - Diagram 219</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I sleepwalked through this game feeling (quite rightly) that I had an enormous positional advantage from move 10 onwards. However, I also felt that it was impossible to lose such a position and, as a result, I stopped paying full attention, expecting victory to happen by itself.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the present position White has a far superior pawn structure, a significant space advantage on the queenside, and a powerful Knight vs. a Tall-Pawn (i.e., black’s very bad Bishop). It’s hard to find anything that Black can be happy about. As a result of all this “basking in the glory of my position,” I got lazy, wrote my opponent off, and forgot that even a badly wounded animal can and will bite. Usually I’m very careful about avoiding enemy counterplay. However, here I just couldn’t imagine him creating anything.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The first thing Black has to do is realize that he’s on death’s door. Once he comes to terms with that, he’ll be able to embrace guiltless desperation. Being honest about one’s position and then being able to kick any and all soft moves away in favor of going for the gusto is far from easy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27…b4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A star move. Computers don’t like it, but if black’s pawn can’t move to b4 then his pieces will be doomed to eternal passivity. In that case Black would have to wait around and pray that White can’t find a winning plan in the center or on the kingside.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After the pawn sacrifice, black’s Bishop (which had Tall-Pawn status for most of the game) can enter the battle on b5 and his Rooks suddenly get use of the b-file. In other words, Black gets active pieces and a chance to fight!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28.Qxb4 Rb7 29.Qc3 Bb5 30.b4?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Disappointed by my earlier errors, I do a psychological belly flop and play like a zombie for the rest of the game. On the other hand, my opponent suddenly turns into a shark. Blood in the water has that effect on some players.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Better was 30.b3 (unlike my 30.b4, this move doesn’t hand the c4-square to black’s Bishop) 30…Kb8 31.Ka1 when White is still better.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30…Kd7 31.Kb2 Rc8 32.Ka3 Bc4 33.Rb2 Rb5 34.Qd2 Qd8 35.Qc3 Rcb8 36.Ka4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Losing—my King rushes to meet his Queen head on! Simply 36.Re3 protects my Queen and prevents any tactical tricks. White would then still be better, with chances to effect a breakthrough in the center or on the kingside. For example: 36.Re3 Ke7 37.Nd3 (37.h3!?) 37…Bxd3 38.Rxd3 Kf8 39.h3 h5 40.Qd2 Kg7 41.Rbb3 Kh7 42.g4 and White triumphs. Of course, Black could defend far better than this, but the line shows white’s general ideas.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">36…Qxa5+! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Arrgh! I desperately imagined myself teleporting away to a kinder, gentler place. Alas, I remained at the board, with about a dozen people surrounding us intently watching as I got gutted.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">37.bxa5 Rxb2 38.Ra1 R8b3 39.Qxb3 Rxb3 40.Re1 Rb2 41.Re3 Rd2</span>, 0-1. A wonderful comeback from my opponent—I was a bit hasty in writing his obituary!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In <span class="italic">Winning With Chess Psychology</span> (Benko and Hochberg, McKay Chess Library 1991), the authors state: “Lasker was often called lucky by those who failed to appreciate his theory that chess was a fight between two personalities. It was his understanding of human fallibility that led him, in 1926, to make the following remarkable assertion in his <span class="italic">Manual of Chess</span>: ‘He who has a slight disadvantage plays more attentively, inventively and more boldly than his antagonist who either takes it easy or aspires after too much. Thus a slight disadvantage is very frequently seen to convert into a good, solid advantage.’”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As evidenced by my own demise in the game we just saw, there’s more than a grain of truth in Lasker’s words!</p>
