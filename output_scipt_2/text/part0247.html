			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="J.-Baird---M.-Weiss--New-York-1889"/>J. Baird - M. Weiss, New York 1889<br class="calibre3"/></span>Black to move</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has just played the strange (and bad) Bd4-h8, no doubt thinking that this Bishop can just go back and forth since it holds the c3-pawn on this diagonal. White most likely also felt that his own King could assure his kingside pawns safety from the hungry eyes of the c4-Bishop, while black’s King has no way into white’s position. As a result, White must have been confident that his defensive fortress would hold things together. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, it soon becomes clear that Mr. Baird was oblivious to the strategic subtleties of the position.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: At the moment the only vulnerable points in white’s position are c3 and g2. However, can Black create a third target? By now, the 1400 players reading this book will be aware of the necessity of creating targets and not just wishing they would appear.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…c5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Very strong and also quite annoying. Seeing that the c3-pawn can’t be undermined, Black cracks b4, thereby turning a5 into a weakness. Then white’s defensive task will be far more difficult since he will have to deal with two weak points on the queenside instead of the lone one on c3.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The ability to not just notice weaknesses, but to also create them, is a major part of Target Consciousness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.bxc5 Bxc5+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Simple and good. Black refuses to be sucked into obscure adventures with 2...Bc7 3.Nd4 Bxa5 4.c6, and instead regains his pawn while maintaining safe, long-term advantages like two active Bishops vs. Bishop and Knight, and pressure against both c3 and a5. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bd4 Bd6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has no intention of relinquishing his two mighty Bishops! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Ke3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White could have put up better resistance by 4.Bb6 (defending a5), but even then his game would have been miserable after 4...Be5 (note the threats against both a5 and c3) 5.Nd4 Bg3+ 6.Ke3 (6.Kg1 Be1) 6...Bf1 7.Ne2 Be1. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">4…Bc7</span>. This move is both obvious and effective. Black went out of his way to create a weakness on a5, and now he’s targeting it for destruction. Since 5.Bb6 fails to 5...Bxb6 6.axb6 Bxe2! 7.Kxe2 Kf6 8.Kd3 a5 followed by ...Kf5-f4-g3xg2xh3 (which wins easily for Black), White had to accept the loss of the a5-pawn and, eventually, the game.</p>
