			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Philidor was known for his love of pawns, and he knew how to use them in ways that hadn’t been seen up to that time. In this game he demonstrates a plan that he was very fond of: create a pawn majority, turn that majority into a passed pawn, and promote the passed pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In our problem position, I had hoped that you would notice white’s four vs. two kingside pawn majority and also note that black has a four vs. two queenside pawn majority. Clearly, both sides need to make use of their majority and prove that what they have is more important than the opponent’s.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This problem is all about the respective pawn majorities. If you noticed them, then consider the puzzle solved.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game itself isn’t something that would make a chess computer happy, but Philidor’s “full steam ahead” single mindedness of vision is extremely instructive. Just watch how he gets his guys in motion!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12…Be6 13.Nf4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White immediately challenges black’s e6 blockade. However, I would have preferred 13.0-0 intending to follow up with f2-f4 and, if allowed, f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Qe7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">13…Bf5 seems more natural, when the Knight on f4 actually blocks its own f-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Bxb6 axb6 15.0–0 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The immediate 15.Nxe6 was more accurate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Nd7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black should have tried the annoying 15…Qg5, though white’s position is still slightly preferable after 16.g3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Nxe6 Qxe6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">We’ve already discussed (in Part Eight) how a Queen isn’t a very good blockader. This is also the case here.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">17.f4 Nc7 18.Rae1 g6 19.h3 </span></p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 419a</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">You have to love this guy! Philidor intends to wash away black’s position by g4 and f5 when his snappy pawn majority makes black’s look like it’s moving in slow motion. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A sharper alternative was 19.f5!? gxf5 20.Qf4 Qe7 (20…Qg6? 21.Bxf5 Ne6 22.Qg3 Rxf5 23.Rxf5 Qxg3 24.hxg3 leaves White with an extra Exchange and a clear advantage) 21.Bxf5 Nc5 when Black intends to block white’s passed e-pawn with …N7e6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19…d4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A serious mistake that hands white’s Knight the e4-square on a platter.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Ne4 h6? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s clear that Black was worried about Ng5, but this weakening of his kingside pawn structure (and the loss of a critical tempo) is too high a price to pay to stop a move that may or may not have been on white’s agenda (this takes us back to the curse of “I must”, which we explored in Part Four). He should have played 20…Kh8, though his game would have been very bad in any case.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.b3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White quietly defends a2 and simultaneously threatens Bc4. However, the more pointed 21.Nd6 (intending a smack-down with 22.f5) was crushing. In this case white’s pawn majority isn’t trying to make a passed pawn, but is instead being used to smash the enemy King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…b5 22.g4?! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">22.Nd6 intending f5 was still strong. However, Philidor isn’t going to allow anything (including good moves!) to distract him from his original vision (i.e., the creation of connected passed pawns after g2-g4 and f4-f5). </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Nd5 23.Ng3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Unrelenting! He’s finally ready to fulfill his dream of f4-f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Ne3 24.Rxe3? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As a fan of Exchange sacrifices, I very much wanted this tempting sacrifice to be sound. Sadly, it’s not. Instead, the quiet 24.Rf2 intending moves such as 25.Nf1 or 25.Ne2 promises White a large, and safe, advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…dxe3 25.Qxe3 Rxa2 26.Re1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Philidor is simply amazing. He plays for f4-f5 all through this game, and when his opponent plonks a Knight onto e3 he just sacrificed material by snapping it off and then got right back on track for his longed for f4-f5 push. Quite simply, his pawns want and need that f4-f5 push, and Philidor is, in a way, a pawn whisperer—he hears their desire and does everything possible to make it come true.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Qxb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not best. Instead, 26…Rb2! is correct, when 27.f5 is met by 27…Qd5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27.Qe4 Qe6 28.f5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The ChessBase team did their own analysis of this classic game, and it was clear that they are huge fans of Philidor and his contributions to modern chess. For me, seeing chess fans get emotionally invested in a plan’s culmination is absolutely delightful! In fact, in their notes they almost gurgled with pleasure as Philidor prepared his f4-f5 advance, and when he finally made his 28th move, they gave a note that will always remain burned into my brain: “YES!! YES!!” I absolutely love this note! That’s the kind of rapture I had when I looked over games in my youth, and it’s very nice to see others with that same wonderful attitude.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Sadly (in fact, tragically), 28.f5 is a losing blunder! Instead, 28.Qxg6+ was correct, when 28…Qxg6 29.Bxg6 Rxf4 (other moves are possible, but White should be fine thanks to his powerful Philidor pawns) is just a draw after 30.e6 Rf3 31.Ne4 Ne5 32.e7 Rg3+!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">33.Nxg3 Nf3+ 34.Kf1 Nh2+ with a perpetual check.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28…gxf5?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">28…Qb3 was a winner. Then 29.f6 is met by 29…Nxe5!, while 29.Qe3 Qd5 threatens both mate and 30…Qc5, exchanging Queens.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game, without notes, was an eventual success for our hero: <span class="bold">29.gxf5 Qd5 30.Qxd5+ cxd5 31.Bxb5 Nb6 32.f6 Rb2 33.Bd3 Kf7 34.Bf5 Nc4 35.Nh5 Rg8+ 36.Bg4 Nd2 37.e6+ Kg6 38.f7 Rf8 39.Nf4+ Kg7 40.Bh5</span>, 1-0. The Philidor pawns had their say after all!</p>
