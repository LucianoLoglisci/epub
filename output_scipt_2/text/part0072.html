			<h3 id="_idParaDest-66" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-17"/>Bowing to Panic</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Decades of teaching have shown me that, when I ask my students why they did or didn’t play a certain move, I usually get answers like, “I can’t do that because…” or “I must play that because…” or “I had to!” or “He has to!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The highly destructive idea that you <span class="italic">must</span> do something you <span class="italic">might not wish to do</span> is so ubiquitous in amateur chess that I would say a player would gain at least a hundred rating points if he managed to rid himself of this one mental/emotional curse.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s take a look at the following position for a very basic example of what I’m talking about. </p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 166</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’ve seen this kind of structure occur in countless amateur games, and far more often than you might imagine, the other side sets up a battery on the h3-pawn via …Bd7 followed by …Qc8. So we’ll say Black plays the “subtle”<span class="bold"> 1…Qc8</span>. In doing this, Black is more or less yelling his aggressive intent to sacrifice on h3 at his opponent. And, over and over again, I’ve seen replies like 2.g4?? h5! 3.gxh5 Bxh3 when we’ve witnessed a self-fulfilling prophecy—white’s kingside will be shattered and his worst nightmare will become a reality, or 2.Kh2? when White has prevented …Bxh3 but made a move he really had no intention of playing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s reactions were created by panic and, though he wasn’t aware of it, he found himself manipulated like a puppet—his opponent (the puppet master) pulls a string and White finds that he no longer is in control of his own actions!</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Do you want to be the puppet or the puppet master?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now we’ll go back to <span class="bold">1…Qc8</span> and see how White <span class="italic">should</span> have reacted! Let’s say White expected 1…b5 when he was going to reply with 2.Bd3, while a quieter move by Black would have seen White respond with 2.a4, nipping black’s queenside expansion in the bud. However, after 1…Qc8 appeared on the board White immediately noted the intention of sacrificing on h3. What should White do about this implied threat? The first thing you have to do is train your mind <span class="italic">not</span><span class="italic"> </span>to writhe in terror. Instead, heap scorn on your opponent’s idea with a hearty (internal!) “Rubbish!” I’m serious! Whenever you see an enemy threat, your first thought should be “Rubbish!” though even stronger language can be used if you find it sets your thinking processes in the right direction!</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">Every threat should initially be looked at with a derisive attitude.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In general, a good player never accepts that an enemy threat will work unless he proves it to himself. In fact, his first impulse when seeing something like …Qc8 is to break out in laughter or, at the very least, a smirk that says, “You don’t expect me to buy into that, do you?” So, if you had intended to play 2.a4 against just about everything but 1…b5, then why not see if you can still play the desired move before looking for something else? The sequence then (physical moves and emotional/intellectual ruminations), will be something like this:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Qc8</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White: “What utter Rubbish! Is this guy serious? I want to play 2.a4, and after 2…Bxh3 3.gxh3 Qxh3 something like 4.Nh2 (4.Ng5 is also good) followed by Qf3 seems to do the trick. Then I’m a piece up and should win the game.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.a4 </span>etc.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As you saw, if Black goes ahead with the intended sacrifice White will have a material advantage and will be well on his way to victory. Thus, stopping a fake threat is akin to stopping your opponent from losing the game! Nobody (beginner or grandmaster) can afford to do that and expect good results.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, you have to prove the threat’s ultimate worth before ignoring or preventing it. If it’s really dangerous, you just shrug your shoulders and say, “Hard to believe, but it seems to be true!” Then you take a moment out to prevent his idea and continue on with your previous plans as soon as possible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The keys here are:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Never believe anything your opponent “tells” you. He’s not your friend! This “don’t believe it until it’s proven” attitude is a trained mental state—you are going to have to force yourself to enter that state by using the word “Rubbish” until it all becomes an unconscious process.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>You’re the only advocate for your position. If you don’t believe in it, who will?</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If there’s a move you really want to play, stick by it and see if that move will still work in the face of the supposed enemy threat.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Train yourself to treat enemy threats with contempt, but don’t be foolhardy! Always analyze the ramifications of allowing the threat before ignoring or preventing it.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Remember, if you prevent a false threat, <span class="italic">you are actually stopping your opponent from losing the game</span>! Think about that—games are hard enough to win without you turning traitor and stopping the opponent from committing suicide!</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-67" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-16"/>It’s My Party and I’ll Move What I Want To</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Training yourself to play the move you <span class="italic">want</span> to play, even in the face of a scary (but ultimately bogus) threat, will pay dividends in every kind of position. In a way, this philosophy should be looked upon as you demanding good things for your position—these “good things” won’t be given to you, so you have to take them while the taking is good!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.Nf3 d5 2.d4 Nc6 3.g3 Nf6 4.Bg2 Bf5</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s most natural move is 5.0-0, but black’s last move not only developed his Bishop but also announced that 5…Nb4 is in the air. “Fear it!” says Black. And many would do just that, renouncing the intended 5.0-0 for a bit of safety via 5.a3 or 5.c3—surely castling can follow once the danger is gone?</p>
			<p class="float-title">in a nutshell</p>
			<p class="float-text">Stopping a fake threat is akin to stopping your opponent from losing the game!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">But why should White waste a tempo to avoid the “danger?” I constantly tell my students that, “Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable commodity and you don’t want to waste them!” So, though both 5.a3 and 5.c3 are playable, are you really getting top value for your gold plated move? Obviously not! Instead, try to make the most valuable move (the move you feel the position really needs) work.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.0-0! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s what you <span class="italic">wanted</span> to do, so <span class="italic">do</span> it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">5…Nb4 6.c3!?</span></p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Every move is like gold. Moves are a very valuable commodity and you don’t want to waste them!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White can now defend c2 with 6.Na3 (White’s most popular choice) or by 6.Ne1. However, 6.c3 demonstrates that black’s “threat” of …Nb4 was certainly nothing to waste a move preventing!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6…Nc2? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Actually 6…Bc2! is best, when 7.Qe1 Nc6 leads to some strange abnormalities (the black Knight didn’t accomplish much, and his light-squared Bishop is also oddly placed, but white’s Queen is far from ideal on e1), while 7.Qd2 Bxb1 8.a3! Be4 9.axb4 is only slightly better for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">7.Nh4 Nxa1 8.Nxf5 </span>and Black, whose a1-Knight is trapped on a1 and will certainly die there, is in serious trouble.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So far we’ve seen that “I can’t” gets its power from one side believing his own propaganda (“My move is strong, fear it!”) and the other bowing to the opponent’s certainty—he tells you (silently … almost psychically) that doing what you want to do is no longer possible because of the threat he just created.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One of the most common situations for brain-melt occurs when one side is quite a bit higher rated than the other. In that case the lower rated player is expecting to lose from move one and, when things get tough, he fully accepts the self-fulfilling prophecy of doom. For example, I once witnessed a game where a grandmaster was playing a 2100 rated opponent. The grandmaster was doing well when he suddenly “hung” a piece. The 2100 looked at it for a long time—to take or not to take? Obviously the grandmaster wouldn’t just give a piece away, so it had to be a trap—the grandmaster was clearly saying, “You’ll die a horrible death if you dare touch that piece.” Eventually the 2100 thought he saw something that might be dangerous and didn’t accept the gift. The grandmaster won easily.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After the game the grandmaster asked, “Why didn’t you take my piece? I would have resigned if you did!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ah, if only Mr. 2100 had screamed (internally) “Rubbish! I’m going to snap that piece off and force him to show me why I can’t!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This story illustrated a one-way delusion—his fear and paranoia combined to create shadows and evil intent that only existed in his own mind. Just as common, though, is a situation where the superior player believes something that’s completely wrong but his air of confidence (and those extra rating points!) quickly convinces the lower rated opponent to dance cheek to cheek down delusion lane.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This “propaganda + rating points = mutual delusion” theorem can be seen in our next example.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 168</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Earlier in the game White had achieved an easily drawn position that was devoid of any danger. However, the higher rated player (Black) outplayed his opponent and achieved some serious-looking kingside threats thanks to his pressure against h4 and his hyperactive King (…Kg4 hitting h4 with a possible …Kf3 if f2 is left unattended).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black was suddenly looking extremely confident and White realized that she had screwed things up. Staring in horror at the mess she had made, she forgot about the clock and her flag fell, thus handing Black the victory that he assured her (after the score sheets were signed) would have been his even if the game had continued.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The next day I got a copy of the game, which ended with the following comment by Miss Uto: “My flag fell, but I can’t draw this anyway.” The higher rated player’s “handing down truth” made such a profound impression that she didn’t bother challenging his comment and she would have continued to believe it if I didn’t immediately e-mail back, “What are you talking about? This is a dead draw. In fact, you should easily draw Kasparov here.” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">And, finally, she did the right thing and challenged <span class="italic">my</span> statement. And this leads us to an important rule: Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person’s view. By doing so, you will build correct mental/emotional habits and also learn a lot by forcing yourself to peer as deeply into a situation as you can.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So, how could White have saved the game? Was it really so easy? Yes it was! All she had to do was play the Bishop back and forth to d8 and e7 (tying the black King to the defense of f6) and it would be time to split the point (if Black moved his King back to e6 White would stick the Bishop on d8 and then dance about with her King). </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, it’s clear that a couple things combined to put White over the edge. The “propaganda + rating points = mutual delusion” theorem was one of the main culprits, but White was also guilty of concentrating on black’s threats (a failing we saw in diagram 166) and didn’t even consider that she could create her own.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-68" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-15"/>The Eerie Phenomenon of Mutual Delusion</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The examples that follow show that delusion and “I can’t” (as in Uto’s “I can’t defend this” and her opponent’s “She can’t defend this”) occur in every possible situation: grandmasters fall victim to it, equally matched players do the same dance of madness, and on and on it goes!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In Kotov’s classic book <span class="italic">Think Like a Grandmaster,</span> he gave an example of this kind of mutual delusion, though in that case he was using it in a discussion about blunders. However, let’s look beyond the blunder and try and understand why this particular kind of mistake is made.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 169</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="A.-Ebralidze---V.-Ragozin--Tbilisi-1937"/>A. Ebralidze - V. Ragozin, Tbilisi 1937<br class="calibre3"/>Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s a pawn up but his Bishop is pinned, his Rook is under attack, and his a7-pawn is also threatened.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Rc7??</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In one sense this is the perfect solution! It saves the Rook, defends the a7-pawn, threatens white’s Rook, and tries to trade into a winning pawn up Bishop vs. Knight endgame after 2.Rxc7 Bd6+ forking the Rook and King. Nice! The only problem is that after 2.Rxc7 Bd6+ is illegal since the Bishop is pinned! Ragozin had simply forgotten about the pin, but he was 100% sure that if White captured on c7 he would achieve a winning endgame. And, as a result of this <span class="italic">knowing</span> that 2.Rxc7 was just what he wanted White to do, the illusion wafted across the board to his opponent.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ebralidze, of course, fully understood his opponent’s idea (“He wants me to take it when …Bd6+ leaves me with a lost endgame.”) and thus succumbed to a form of Vulcan mind meld—he saw what Black saw, knew what Black knew, and felt the certainty that Black undoubtedly felt. And so it came to pass that both players were in complete agreement that 2.Rxc7 led to a lost endgame for White. It’s interesting to note that a member of the audience became so agitated that Ebralidze wasn’t devouring the gift and winning the game that he screamed, “Archil, take his Rook!” Poor Ebralidze, completely immersed in black’s reality, gave the fool in the audience an angry glance (No doubt thinking, “I can’t take it you idiot! Aren’t you even good enough to see such a basic Bishop fork?”) and retreated his Rook from d7 to d5. The ultimate irony is that he ended up falling for the very thing he feared most—the Bishop forking his Rook and King: <span class="bold">2.Rd5?? Bf6 3.Nb5 Rc2+ 4.Kg3 a6 5.Rd7+ Ke8 6.Rc7 Be5+</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What we have here isn’t a blunder created by flawed calculation—instead it’s a picture perfect but extreme case of “falling under the spell” of the opponent’s dementia. A kind of mass hallucination!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I loved this story when I first read Kotov’s book, but it seemed a bit farfetched to me. But, as fate would have it, I experienced almost the exact same thing while coaching the American junior team with Pal Benko in Szeged, Hungary.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Since coaches were not allowed in the playing hall for fear that they would speak to players, Benko and I were watching from way up above in the balcony. Black has just played his Queen to g2, checking white’s King. It’s clear that Black has a big advantage and we were sure Josh was going to win this game. After giving the check, he only had five minutes for the next few moves, but surely that would prove to be more than enough?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Qf2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We had expected 1.Qxg2 Rxg2+ 2.Kd3 (2.Kd1 puts up a better fight) 2…Rf2 3.Rxh5+ Kg7 4.Rh3 b5 when white’s in zugzwang and has to give up material: 5.Rh1 Rxf3+ 6.Kd2 Kg6 and Black should score the full point—7.Rh8 Kf5 8.Rc8 Rf1 9.Rxc6 Ra1 10.Rb6 a4 11.Rxb5 Ke4 12.Rb8 f3 13.Rf8 Rxa3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, 1.Qf2 seemed odd. How did we miss it? Then reality hit us both in the face—this simply hangs the h1-Rook! Of course, it was clear that White wasn’t aware h1 was floating in the breeze, no doubt feeling that it was defended a moment ago and so “Black still can’t take it.” Good news for us since now, after the obvious 1…Qxh1, White would resign and we could begin looking at the games of our other players.</p>
			<p class="float-title">rule</p>
			<p class="float-text">Always challenge everything until you have, to the best of your ability, proven or disproven the other person’s view.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">But no—instead of snapping off the free Rook (followed by …Rg2 to boot), Josh sank into deep thought. In fact, he seemed disturbed by 1.Qf2—for some reason he thought this wasn’t possible (just like our initial reaction!) and couldn’t understand why it was now staring him in the face! One minute ticked by, then two, and it became clear that Josh had bought into white’s “he can’t take the Rook” (which translates into black’s “I can’t”) delusion.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Naturally we were both freaking out from our perch, and after a third minute passed, Benko started muttering, “Take the Rook! Why isn’t he taking the Rook?” I told him to be quiet, but another thirty seconds went by (leaving Josh with just ninety seconds) and Pal, who had lost all control, started raising his voice as he repeated the Rook mantra, “Take the Rook! Why can’t he take the Rook?” Of course, the arbiters would not take kindly to the coaches sharing this kind of information, so I quickly grabbed Benko and dragged him away from our scene of anguish. After using up all but a minute (Black was clearly wondering, “How did I miss this defense?”), Josh finally played <span class="bold">1…Qg6 </span>and after<span class="bold"> 2.Kd2 Qf5 3.Rh4 Rg5 4.Kc1 Qg6 5.Qh2 Kg8 </span>he was once again winning and soon scored the full point: <span class="bold">6.Qd2 Rg2 7.Qd3 Qg5 8.Rh3 h4 9.Kb2 Rg3 10.Rh2 h3 11.c4 dxc4 12.Qxc4 Qf5 13.Qe2 Kf7 14.Qe1 Rg2</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As you can see, if the opponent’s delusion can create “I can’t” so powerfully that you aren’t able to see a one move snatch of a hanging Rook, imagine how easy it is to buy into something believable, like a threat. That’s why you have to use the “Rubbish!” prompt when an enemy threat appears. And if the opponent plays a move that you never imagined (e.g. 1.Qf2 in the Waitzkin game), instead of allowing yourself to get confused, seek instant clarity by asking, “How can I punish this?” The logic is clear: if you didn’t anticipate his response, then it must be bad and thus deserves to be punished! This is a much healthier mindset than seeing an unexpected move and thinking, “I missed it! I must be doomed!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once again, both “Rubbish!” and “How can I punish this?” are positive prompts that set an upbeat tone and allow you to see through the opponent’s haze. Start training yourself to use them right away!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When you accept “I can’t” into your chess life (okay, you shouldn’t accept it into any part of your life, but that’s way off topic), you’ll find that various missed opportunities litter your games.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, if you have plenty of time left for thought, why tip your King when you can calmly look at the board for something/anything that might offer some hope? The old saying, “Nobody ever won a game by resigning” is hard to argue with, so why not use that clock time to seek a miracle? </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Consider this: if you had a pack of 20 rabid dogs just a minute away from your throat and your only means of “escape” appeared to be leaping several hundred yards onto the jagged rocks below, what would you do? Leap? Lie down and wait to die? Weep until the dogs put you out of your misery? Or, would you use every second of your final bit of time trying your best to figure out some mind-bending way to save your skin?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In chess, you need to put that same emotional burst of energy into hard-to-defend positions as you would a life and death situation. If you think, “I’m doomed” (an offshoot of “I can’t”), then you <span class="italic">will</span> be doomed. Crotto chose the “doom” scenario, but it turns out that salvation was there, just waiting to be discovered: <span class="bold">1.h3! Rbb3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is the move that convinced Crotto to give up all hope and resign (it <span class="italic">does</span> look bad!). Oddly, better is 1…Ra2 2.Rcc7 Rf8 3.Rc6 Ra5 4.Rcxa6 Rxe5, but Black would have little hope of success after 5.Re7 Re4 6.Raa7.</p>

She knew there was something fishy about 18…exd5, but wasn’t 18…Qxd5 19.Nxf6+ even worse since her King would be ripped open? “I can’t allow that” immediately shut down all higher brain functions, and she chopped on d5 with the pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…exd5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Perhaps part of the fear of opening up her King was caused by her opponent’s strength—Israeli grandmaster Ronen Har-Zvi is a very tough customer! However, if you find yourself playing both the board <span class="italic">and</span> a rating, you’re pretty much up the creek. It’s interesting to note that chess is very much a caste system. I remember one tournament where I entered an elevator and, as the door closed, some guy squeezed in. He asked if I was Jeremy Silman, I said yes, shook his hand, and said, “It’s a pleasure meeting you. What’s your name?” His reply stunned me: “Oh, you don’t want to know my name, my rating is too low!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though this was shocking, I had actually experienced the whole “caste game” earlier in my career. When I was a child and just starting out (with a 1068 rating), players 1400 and above pretty much steered clear of me—I just wasn’t strong enough to hang with them. And when I had an expert rating a few years later, I vividly recall watching a couple of strong masters enjoying some five-minute chess in between rounds at a tournament in Salt Lake City. I asked if I could play the winner, and the stronger of the two said, “Sorry, but I only play people that are good!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Those ratings hold a lot of power in chess, and I think just about every player is vulnerable to “rating fear” (a serious disease that only affects chess addicts). When I was rated in the 1800s, I had a terrible time dealing with those 2000+ gods. As soon as I saw a rating of 2000 or higher I would freeze and lose like a lamb. Finally I had had enough and decided to only look at an opponent’s rating <span class="italic">after</span><span class="italic"> </span>the game was over. I implemented this in my very next tournament and was quickly paired with some guy that I wasn’t familiar with. I didn’t know his rating but, after a dozen moves, came to the conclusion that he was in the 1600—1800 range. I wiped him out and was stunned to discover that he was rated 2182! After that, I lost my fear of experts (2000 to 2199)—it was no longer a matter of numbers; I firmly believed they weren’t a threat and that belief propelled me past them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There’s absolutely no doubt that confidence plays a huge role in chess. Those who are paired with a higher rated player and think, “I’m doomed,” will find that the evisceration that follows will be quick and quite painful. On the other hand, the guy who revels in the pairing against a higher rated opponent and honestly feels he will crush his egotistical foe usually has quite a few scalps on his wall.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is why an unproven “I can’t” is such a crippling mindset. You are giving power to your own insecurity and to your opponent, and that alone makes you a huge underdog in the coming battle.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If girl-brain hadn’t been facing a chess titan, perhaps she would have tried to prove/disprove her initial feeling that 18…Qxd5 (The move Black <span class="italic">wants</span> to play since the Queen is beautifully placed on d5 and the d4-pawn will prove to be a permanent target—remember, if there’s a move you want to play, try hard to make it work!) 19.Nxf6+ gxf6 was too risky. And, in doing so, she might have realized that Black actually has an excellent game. Let’s look at a few examples after 20.Qh5 (not good, but it’s the kind of thing that would scare an “I can’t” addict into not entering this as Black) 20…Kh7 (defending h6 and preparing to make use of the g-file with …Rg8): </p>

			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>21.g4?? is white’s big try to refute black’s setup, but it’s powerfully met in many ways: 21…Rg8 (21…Qf3!? and 21…Rad8!? are also very strong) 22.Qxf7+ (loses, but White was already in serious trouble) 22…Rg7 23.Qh5 Qf3 and it’s time for White to resign.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As you can see, Black would have had a lot of fun with 18…Qxd5, but she convinced herself that she couldn’t do it and thus potential fun turned into misery.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Qf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This forces the win of a pawn (after 19…h5 20.Qxf5 hxg4 21.Qxg4), though Black will (luckily) be able to claim some compensation for it. Nevertheless, Black, who didn’t intend to lose material and had lost all confidence in herself, completely fell apart and lost quickly.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, an “I can’t” moment is rarely based on any profound considerations. You glance at a logical possibility, emotion takes over and screams the “I can’t” refrain, and you do something that has little to do with the needs of the position. This happens all the time and the only cure is to <span class="italic">insist</span> on finding a way to make the desired move work. Don’t give up on it unless you’ve completely proven that it’s bad!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Things have gone well for Black in this extremely theoretical variation of the Slav. Here Black played 22…f5?! when after 23.Bd3 his Rooks weren’t nearly as active as they could have been after the more natural and far stronger 22…Rc2. During a lesson, I asked Jeremy Stein (who was a strong expert at this time) why he didn’t bring his Rook to its 7th rank and he said, “I intended to do that but then I saw 23.Bd3. I realized that I couldn’t play 22…Rc2 so I gave 22…f5 a try.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In black’s mind, the mere sight of a developing move that simultaneously attacked a Rook caused him to instantly label the move he wanted to play as bad. Instead of analyzing the position after 22…Rc2 23.Bd3 and trying to see what was really going on, he dropped 22…Rc2 like a hot potato. In fact, he tried to put 22…f5 on the board so we could look at the game continuation but I placed the f-pawn back on f6 and said, “Show me why 22…Rc2 23.Bd3 Rxb2 or 23…Rxg2 isn’t just very pleasant for you.” He quickly agreed that it was far superior to the move played. Then I added, “Jeremy, do you see what’s happening here? I’m defending the move you wanted to play. Why didn’t you defend it in the game?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To be fair to Mr. Stein, everyone of every rating falls victim to thoughts like “I can’t” and “I have to”. The difference is, though grandmasters occasionally cave in to its influence, amateurs are universally enslaved by it! Training oneself to avoid it (at least to some degree) will make an enormous and instantaneous impact on your results and on your general mindset—you’ll find yourself pushing your own agenda more and laughing at your opponent’s feeble attempts to take you off the proper path.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has a small but permanent edge thanks to his superior pawn structure and total control over the d5-square. Black, whose Knight is under attack, should play the obvious 1…Nb6 followed by 2…Nd5 when White would have to defend for a long time in order to earn a draw. Instead, something strange occurred.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Ba5??</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very odd. Black is saying, “You have to move your Knight or take on c4 and allow a trade.” Of course, “You have to” drinks from the same cup of laziness as “I can’t.” Yes, it’s possible that White does indeed have to move it (though it wouldn’t bother him if he did), but when you have a Knight hanging out to dry (White’s itching to play Kxc4) you better be sure “you have to” is 100% accurate!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.b4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Euwe must have experienced that “I’m going to throw up” feeling after this appeared on the board and reality came crashing down on his head. Both black pieces are now attacked, so the Bishop has to capture on b4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Bxb4 3.Nc2</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The point. By sacrificing the b-pawn, White lured the Bishop to b4 where it would be in striking range of the Knight. After 3.Nc2 Black loses a piece and eventually lost the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In general, “I can’t” or “He has to/I have to” appears due to:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Lack of proper concentration.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Bad mental habits.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Allowing emotion to override logic.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Not being strong enough to prove whether or not an “I can’t” or “He has to” is actually correct.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We all run into situations that are above our level, and there’s no shame in that (such moments can act as wonderful learning tools). A lack of concentration can occur due to some outside influence (for example, you were just told that you’re going to be audited) or you are just having a “bad hair day.” We can’t prevent negative biorhythms or some personal Apocalypse from smacking us down from time to time, but we can work on improving concentration, quieting an overly emotional mind, and most definitely fixing mental habits that only lead to anguish.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If you want to defeat “I can’t” then you simply must make use of the “Rubbish!” tool. In fact, challenge every quiet command (you saying “I can’t”, your opponent saying “You have to”, etc.) that comes your way. To succeed in this, you have to go over your games from the last several months and look for the moments where things went sour. A computer will help you find those tactical moments, while a teacher will help you with the positional meltdowns. And, in both cases, you’ll find that a large percentage of your “slips” were caused by some form of mental surrender. The only way to fix this problem is to be introduced to its existence (which we’re doing here), to find instances of it in your own games (thus personalizing it), and then to use the “Rubbish!” tool to train you to stop and challenge every negative thought that your own brain or your opponent tosses your way.</p>
