			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In 2009 I was asked by the website chess.com to write a question-and-answer column for players ranging from complete beginners to titled players. Naturally, everything one could imagine was asked, ranging from opening theory to study habits to diet to whether or not a person was qualified to teach chess to children. Later, it occurred to me that some of my answers would nicely complement the chapters in this book, while others would embrace completely new (but highly useful) subjects. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As a result, often-asked topics like “How to create an opening repertoire” will please those interested in opening study, while practical but rarely voiced questions like “what to eat during a tournament” and “how to offer a draw” should prove extremely interesting to a myriad of readers who often wondered about such things, but didn’t know where to look for an answer.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Tom asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">If I’m doing a tactical puzzle, should I be looking at the imbalances before I start calculating? Or does this not apply when you know there’s a tactical shot in the position?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Tom,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Imbalances (space, material, pawn structure, weak squares, superior/inferior minor pieces, etc.) offer a player a firm grasp of what’s happening in any given position. Instead of looking at a position and not knowing what in the world is going on, you can train yourself to quickly recognize any and all imbalances for both sides. Then, any move you consider will have something to do with the positive/negative features on the board.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Most players simply calculate. For example, when looking at their position (as the clock ticks) they internally say, “I go there and he goes there and I go there, etc.” However, if I were to ask them at that exact moment to lecture me on the ins and outs of the position, they will usually be way off, or in many cases even clueless. How can you find a move that conforms to the needs of a position if you don’t know what those needs are?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Tactics are another matter. Having the ability to calculate deeply is a huge plus, but few can do it. In fact, though you can work on and improve your ability to calculate to some degree, possessing the ability to calculate deeply, quickly, and accurately (at a GM level) is a god given gift (don’t mix this up with learning tactical patterns—it’s relatively easy to vastly improve your tactical IQ by the study of each mating pattern, each basic tactical pattern [forks, pins, etc.], and going over all sorts of tactical puzzles).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I tend to place very high-level calculation under the umbrella of “talent,” while positional skills are something everyone can learn and excel at. Oddly, few players hone their positional skills, preferring to muddle through with a good tactical IQ and poor calculation. Sadly, many players that do have serious calculation mojo rely on that skill set while ignoring all the others (I’ve known several IMs that have grandmaster level tactical ability but 2300 positional skills).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When looking over a “find the tactic” type problem, you can indeed just look for the tactical solution (since it’s been announced that there is one). Be aware that almost all tactics are based on double attacks, undefended (or inadequately defended) pieces, and/or a vulnerable King—that will make it easier to find.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, in actual play no voice of authority says, “Tom, there is a tactic here. Find the tactic Tom!” Thus (in a real game), it’s important to do that imbalance rundown so you know exactly what’s going on in every position you reach, while also asking (after you do the imbalance thing) if there are any double attacks and/or undefended/inadequately defended pieces, and if the enemy King appears vulnerable to a karate chop to the throat.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In some situations you’ll find that there is a tactic, but it gives you less than the correct positional move. Here’s an example:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">Here’s a line in the Semi-Slav that used to be fairly popular: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bd6 7.0–0 0–0 8.e4 and now 8…dxc4 is black’s best move since 8…dxe4 9.Nxe4 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 e5?? (10…h6, intending 11...e5, is a better try) 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5 Bxe5 (Black has an undefended piece, so White finds a tactic based on that and a double attack) 13.Bxh7+! Kxh7 14.Qh5+ Kg8 15.Qxe5 leaves White with a solid extra pawn and a huge plus.</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">An almost identical position was often reached by 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bb4 7.0-0 0-0 8.a3 Bd6 (it seems that White got a2-a3 in for free, why would Black allow this?) 9.e4 dxe4 10.Nxe4 Nxe4 11.Bxe4 e5 and here, in the game <a id="G.-Kasparov---R.-Huebner--Brussels-1986"/>G. Kasparov - R. Huebner, Brussels 1986, the great K played 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Re1 exd4 14.Rxe8+ Qxe8 15.Qxd4 Be7 16.Bg5 Bxg5 17.Nxg5 Nf6 18.Rd1 Be6 19.Re1 Qd8 20.Nxe6 fxe6 21.Qe3 Kh8 22.h3 Qd7 23.g4 Re8 24.Qe5 Qd8 25.Kg2 Qb6 26.Rd1 c5 27.Ba4 Rf8 28.Rd6 Qc7 29.Rxe6 Qf7 30.Qxc5 Nxg4 31.Qxf8+ Qxf8 32.hxg4, 1-0. White regains the Queen with Re8 and ends up with an extra piece.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">At this point, astute readers will be asking, “Wait a second! Did Kasparov really miss the same tactic from the previous example?” Let’s see if it still works: 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.Bxh7+ Kxh7 15.Qh5+ Kg8 16.Qxe5 with an extra pawn. Yep, the tactic does indeed work. Of course, Kasparov saw that he could do this, but was also aware that this position (after 16.Qxe5), though a bit better for White, is basically drawn!!!</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">I can imagine that many of you are now shaking your head with pity. “Silman must have hit his head again! The poor fool doesn’t realize it’s the same position.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">But, is it really the same position? There’s one “small” difference: White’s a-pawn is on a3 in the Kasparov game, and on a2 in the earlier position with 6…Bd6. In fact, players with Black often chose 6…Bb4 7.a3 Bd6 hoping to get this very same pawn down (drawn) position, while the pawn down position with the a-pawn on a2 is more or less lost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This still sounds like gibberish (thereby strengthening the concussion theory), but here’s the rub: All the tactical skill in the world won’t give you the answer, but a positionally trained eye will tell you that, with a2-a3 in, the b3-square is weakened and, after 16…Qd3, White is forced to push his c-pawn (in the position with 6…Bd6 White would simply play 17.b3), thereby giving black’s light-squared Bishop access to d5 (that, combined with the Bishops of opposite colors, makes it more or less impossible for White to win). Many games were drawn from this position. Here’s one example: 17.c5 Be6 18.Bf4 Bd5 19.Rfe1 f6 20.Qh5 Bf7 21.Qg4 Rfe8 22.h3 Qc4 and Black drew without too much difficulty in <a id="B.-Larsen---A.-Bisguier--San-Juan-1969"/>B. Larsen - A. Bisguier, San Juan 1969.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">You may see a number of tactics in various games, but is the pretty combination really the best way to play the position? If you don’t have a grasp of the imbalances, you’ll have no way to answer that question. Ultimately, high-level chess is a game that demands balance. Tactics without positional skills just won’t hold up, while positional skills without tactics will also fall on its face.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-154" class="sub-chapter1"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-10"/>Help! I Need a Plan!</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">IM David Pruess asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I do know a few things about planning—I even teach “how to plan” to my own students sometimes. But I still come across positions fairly often, maybe one in ten games, where I feel I should have a plan, but can’t come up with anything. Typically I get into time trouble in such games. Now, I believe there are games where you don’t need a long-term plan, just a series of 2-3 move operations; but I have the distinct feeling that in these games I am thinking of there was a good plan to be had.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I’m going to include the opening moves of this game, because they are kind of interesting, and might help a tiny bit in orienting yourself to the position I am interested in:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1"><span class="bold">1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 d5 3.d4 c6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Qc2 Bd6 6.Nf3 Ne7 7.Bg5 f6 8.Bh4 Bf5 9.Qd2 0-0 10.Bg3 Be4 11.e3 Bxf3 12.gxf3 f5 13.Bxd6 Qxd6 14.f4</span></p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div class="diagram-os2">
					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00628.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">So first of all, my state of mind at this point: I was quite selbst-zufrieden, a little bit self-congratulatory about the success of my “interesting idea” of …f6, …Bf5-e4. I evaluated the position fairly optimistically based on these factors: I felt my position had enough space, my pieces could all find decent squares, f5 and g7 could be defended by pieces so I would not have to push g6, and I had even inflicted a slight structural weakness on white that might eventually tell.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I also thought that White had a little question to figure out with his King. If he castled queenside, I thought I might have the stronger attack when I advanced my pawns there, as the kingside seemed pretty static. If he castled kingside, maybe his pawn weaknesses there would allow me to lift my rooks via the third rank and generate some attack there too.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, over the next few moves, the psychological initiative swung back my opponent’s way, as he made several pretty quick moves, and I began to burn up time, unable to come up with any plan. He left his king in the center, so I could not go for any direct attack.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now, often, I make a plan by picking a part of the board where I think I am stronger (or potentially stronger) than the opponent. This was not helpful here. Other times, I look at some piece of mine and ask: where would I put it ideally—in this position I had trouble doing that for my knights.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Thanks in advance for any light you can shed on this for me!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Mr. Pruess,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I think the vast majority of positions call for 2-3 move operations. Of course, this comes after you decide whether the position is static or dynamic in nature, and what the various imbalances for both sides are (a trained player does all that in seconds). Then you quickly decide what move(s) fit the needs of the position and analyze them and all tactics that arise from them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is why, in my 4th Edition of <span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess</span>, I stress the need for every player to master the necessary (but simple) skill of recognizing imbalances over any particular thinking technique since that one thing gives you a firm handle on a position’s nature and its needs.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Having said that, there are times when a position calls for a far deeper plan or, on very rare occasions, even a “grand plan.” For example, in the following game (I’ll use examples from my own practice since it saves me the trouble of looking up other sources and I also know what I was thinking, which is very important in the context of this article.) I used a grand plan, which enabled me to pretty much “see” the way the game would go from move 18 to 38.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="D.-Gliksman---J.-Silman--Software-Toolworks-1988"/>D. Gliksman - J. Silman, Software Toolworks 1988</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+ 4.Nc3 c5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This is the Huebner Variation of the Nimzo-Indian, a line that instantly creates a Bishop versus Knight imbalance in the hope of proving that the upcoming pawn structure (made possible by the lack of flexibility of white’s doubled pawns) will prove conducive to Knights.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As you play through the game, you’ll see just how important that Knight vs. Bishop battle was—it raged from the opening to the endgame. This in itself can be considered a rather basic plan, though others might think of it as a means of creating a long-term static plus. If the student learns to create this kind of logical plan (which conforms to the dictates of the position), then he’ll do very well for himself.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.bxc3 d6 8.0-0 e5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A major part of Black’s strategy—by closing the position he keeps the Bishops at bay.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Nd2 0-0</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black refuses to win a pawn by 9...cxd4 10.cxd4 exd4 11.exd4 Nxd4 since after 12.Bb2 white’s Bishops would be very strong on their wide open diagonals.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.d5 Ne7 11.f4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is still trying to open up lines for his Bishops. In addition, Black must take the threat of 12.f5 (gaining a crushing advantage in space) very seriously.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11…exf4 12.exf4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Again threatening 13.f5, which would activate his dark-squared Bishop and squeeze Black to death due to his lack of territory.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12…Bf5!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A tremendously important move! This simultaneously exchanges a pair of Bishops (depriving White of his Bishop pair) and stops the advance of White’s f-pawn in its tracks.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.Qc2</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Beginning a battle for the f5-square. Less good is 13.Bxf5 Nxf5 14.Nf3 h5! preventing a g2-g4 push and ensuring that f5 will remain in Black’s hands.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…Qd7</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And not 13...Bxd3? 14.Qxd3 g6 (14...Qd7 15.f5 is horrible for Black) 15.f5! Nxf5 16.Rxf5 gxf5 17.Qxf5 when the dormant Bishop is suddenly a major player: 17...Re8 18.Nf3 (Threatening 19.Bg5 with a crushing pin.) 18...Ne4 19.Ng5. Obviously, Black can’t lose the fight for the f5-square since that would also lose the battle of the minor pieces!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.Ne4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This leads to a strategically lost position. However, White would also feel no joy after 14.Nf3 g6 15.Nh4 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 Qg4 (Forcing White to further damage his Bishop by bringing another pawn to a dark square.) 17.g3 Nf5 18.Nxf5 Qxf5 19.Qxf5 gxf5 when White’s Bishop is absolutely horrible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Nxe4 15.Bxe4 Rae8 16.Bd2 Bxe4 17.Qxe4 f5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Permanently blocking the position and creating a nice support point on e4 for the Black Knight and/or Rooks.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1"><span class="bold">18.Qd3 Nc8</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">And here we come to the “grand plan.” After this, I had worked everything out and, incredibly, it all actually occurred!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">My old note: A move with an obvious threat and a much deeper, hidden, purpose. If left alone, Black will surround White’s c4-pawn by ...Nb6 followed by ...Qa4. White can prevent this and chase the Knight back by a2-a4-a5, but that brings White’s a-pawn into striking distance of Black’s b-pawn, allowing an eventual ...b7-b6 advance which will lead to the creation of a winning passed a-pawn for Black.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The rest of the game was already clear to me, I only had to work out individual tactics, never allowing White to veer the game off the positional path I had foreseen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">19.Rfe1 Nb6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The threat of ...Qa4 is very annoying for White, so he stops it in the only way possible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.a4 Rxe1+ 21.Bxe1 Re8</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Also possible is 21...Nxa4 22.Qd1 Nb6 23.Rxa7 Nxc4, but I didn’t see a need to give White any possible counterplay. I was much happier simply keeping his pieces contained and helpless.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22.a5 Nc8 23.Bh4 g6 24.Re1 Rxe1+ 25.Bxe1 Qe7 26.Bf2 Kf7 27.Qb1 a6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game is now over. Black’s plan (prepared on move 18) is now simplicity itself: he will march his King over to c7 and play ...b7-b6. The passed a-pawn that results will prove decisive.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1"><span class="bold">28.h3 h5 29.Qc2 Ke8 30.Qb1 Kd8 31.g4 hxg4 32.hxg4 Qf7 33.gxf5 gxf5 34.Bh4+ Kc7 35.Bg5 Qd7 36.Kg2 b6 37.Qa2 Kb7 38.axb6 Nxb6</span></p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">This was more or less what I had played for from move 18—the grand plan is over and it’s been extremely successful!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">39.Qe2 a5 40.Kg3 a4 41.Kf2 a3 42.Qa2 Qa4 43.Bd8 Nxc4 44.Qe2 a2 45.Qe7+ Ka6 46.Qc7</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Threatening perpetual check. Black’s next move prevents this.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">46…Qb5</span>, 0-1. So how did I see so far? Actually there was very little calculation. To me, the position seemed to “absorb” these ideas in a natural way and it seems all too natural for the path I created to be followed (that’s not to say that a stronger opponent wouldn’t have veered off course!).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">When a “grand plan” is used, it usually means that:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>The stronger side has a huge advantage and the defender is hard pressed to stop his opponent’s intentions.</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>The strategic elements are so clearly defined that it would take a blind man not to see the potential long-term continuation right through to the end. When this occurs, it’s up to the defending side to notice his opponent’s intention and do everything he can to prevent it from going “according to script.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I got to play another grand plan against a very strong IM. This time the plan was more general, but just as effective.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Usually White is delighted to exchange light-squared Bishops in KID structures. The text isn’t as bad as it looks: Black’s King is quite safe on f8 and his kingside pawn storm can become very threatening.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">And here I mapped out a “grand plan.” However, it was based on simple concepts—I knew the moves to support those concepts would be found as the game went on since I already deemed my position (whether it’s true or not!) strategically won.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The PLAN:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>First I map out huge territorial gains on the queenside.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Then I deprive my opponent of any real play on the kingside.</p>

			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Eventually I effect a decisive penetration on the queenside—most likely on the c-file.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Knight heads for c4 where, at first glance, it will work with my Queen against Black’s d-pawn. However, there is an even more nefarious purpose to this Knight maneuver.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Nh8 25.Nc4 Nf7 26.Ne3</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">My only weakness (on f2) is solidly defended, while Black is going to have to worry about g4, f5, d6, b7, and possible intrusions along the c-file for a long time to come.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Hoping to gain counterplay by sacrificing the Exchange, i.e., 29...Rxf2 30.Rxf2 Qxe3. Of course, I don’t allow this to happen.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As I said earlier, “grand plans” are rare, and usually one simply plays moves (Pruess’ 2 to 3 move operations) that suit the particular position (again, based on the specific imbalances and on the position’s dynamic or static needs). Here’s a case of a dynamic, tactical situation:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Though many positions call for a quick set of moves, this isn’t one of them! The basic details are easy to map out:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Black only has two pawn breaks: …c6-c5 (a dynamic move that makes d4 and d5 very weak … however, it’s his main break and is thus very important!) and …g7-g5 (which won’t be happening any time soon, but remains a very real possibility down the line a bit!). Black can also preface …c5 with …b6 so that a capture on c5 would allow …bxc5.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Pawn advances for Black are …a7-a5-a4-a3 and/or the advance of the b-pawn. But …b7-b5 leaves c5 and c6 weak—this might not matter, or it might have profound long-term static ramifications.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>White’s breaks are: b2-b4-b5 (minority attack, which I don’t see happening in this exact position) and f2-f3 followed by e3-e4, which leads to all sorts of potentially catastrophic pawn weaknesses. Of course, f2-f3 without e3-e4 is also important since, though it weakens e3, it also deprives the enemy Knights of e4 and g4.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Other factors: White has the half open g-file and can try and make his potentially weak h-pawn into a dynamic asset by h2-h4-h5-h6.</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>One other key question is: where to put the white King?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">ALL of this zips through my mind quickly as a result of training and retained patterns from millions of games/structures. But in this case, it doesn’t give me a clear answer! It seems simple, but it’s actually a very tough position, and (in a real game situation) I would sit there and stare for ages, balancing all these considerations and trying to form a logical continuation/plan.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Again: If you aren’t armed with these elementary details, then it’s impossible to play the position with any intelligence!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">If I was sitting at the board actually playing this position, other ideas would—in haphazard fashion—flit through my aged and rapidly decomposing brain:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>If Black goes for queenside pawns on a4 and b5, then a2-a3 followed by Nc3-a2-b4 hits c6 and d5 and prepares Nd3 with control over c5 and e5. This isn’t necessarily bad for Black, but it’s something he has to take into consideration.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>If Black plays …a5 and …b5, I can respond with a2-a4 …b4 Ne2 hoping to bring my Knight to d3 or b3 and Rooks to the c-file so I can play whack-a-mole against c6 while also pressuring a5 and c5.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>If White pushes his h-pawn down the board, Black will let it go to h6 (playing …h6 himself leaves a hole on g6 that White might be able to utilize, it also makes defending f5 harder since …g7-g6 is no longer “on”) and then close up the g-file with …g6—the pawn on h6 might really bother black’s King later in the game, but also closes off the g-file and, in endgames, might become weak (or it might fix h7 and turn into a tower of strength!).</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Black will likely try to push his a-pawn all the way down to a3.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>If black’s pawns get to a4 and b5 (with my pawn on a3), he will likely swing a Knight to c4.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Black might wish to leave his b-pawn on b7, when there aren’t any serious weaknesses in black’s camp (the e5-square and placing a bit of pressure against f5 by Bd3 and Nc3-e2-g3 stand out). In that case, it will be hard for White to find an active plan. On the other hand, Black can only get active if he loosens his own position up.</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>If Black does leave his b-pawn on b7, White has to be wary about the following scenario: (one with white’s pawn on h6) Black plays …Nf6 and …Ne4. White trades, Black takes back with …fxe4 and then swings his remaining Knight to f5. If White chops that Knight by Bg4xf5, Black will recapture with his Rook, perhaps double on the f-file, play …Kh8, and then smash through with …g6-g5. This series of moves, more than any other, strikes me (from white’s point of view) as disturbing. This might compel me to take measures to avoid it by playing f2-f3, stopping the whole …Ne4 thing from ever happening.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Again, I didn’t do any actual calculation—instead I explored various pawn and piece configurations in an effort to deem what ones were most dangerous for both sides. It seems that Black has a slightly easier time leading the dance, though I consider things to be more or less equal.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Anything could happen in this game! Here’s a hypothetical series of moves: Black would most likely play 14…Nd7 when I (as White) would temporize a bit and push my h-pawn (since it’s something I know I need to do): 15.h4 a5 16.h5 Nf6 17.f3 (Perhaps not necessary since the …Ne4 plan, with an eye to a later …g5 push, isn’t effective if white’s pawn hasn’t gone to h6. On the other hand, I don’t like Black dictating things, so I might go with 17.f3 since it dominates his Knights) 17…a4 18.Bd3 when I would follow up with Rc1, Kf2 and … it’s just a game that offers mutual chances.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">E. J. asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I have a question that can get rid of some thorns in my mind if answered. What is a plan? I mean, how do I plan? Also, how do I know what plan is right for me? This whole “plan thing” among grandmasters is getting really confusing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Mr. E. J. ,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Eliot, you’re not alone! Many players haven’t grasped the concept of planning. Quite simply, a plan is a way of taking advantage of the positive features (imbalances) in your position and the negative imbalances in the opponent’s. For example, if the opponent has an isolated pawn on an open file, a logical plan would be to bring as many pieces as possible to bear on it. Double or even triple your heavy pieces on the open file. Let a Knight and Bishop join in on the destruction of that poor pawn. Remember: chess is a team effort and you want your whole army to work together towards a particular goal.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">You said something very interesting: “How do I know what plan is right for me?” The fact is, in most cases a plan isn’t based on what’s right for you. It’s not a personal decision. A plan is something the board wants (even needs!) you to do. And it’s up to you to learn to read the body language of the board and ascertain what the proper plan is. Thus, you might be the greatest tactical genius the world has ever seen, but if the right plan is to quietly take more space and squeeze him to death, then that’s what you have to do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Abhilash_007 asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">How do you decide it’s time to map a grand plan?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Abhilash_007,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Grand plans are rare, even in grandmaster chess. To create them, you need to have a deep understanding of the given position’s inherent tactics, structural needs, and the way both sides pieces can help/inhibit those needs. And you would only create one if you are positive that the basics of the position will remain unchanged for many, many moves. This tends to be very advanced, and I don’t think that any amateur of any rating should be looking for grand plans. Appreciating them while going over an annotated game is one thing, but actually beating your head against a brick wall in the hope of creating one is quite another.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One reason that a grand plan is rare is that the opponent can always do something that alters the trajectory of even the most logical train of thought. A chess position is always changing, and thus a grand plan rarely stays valid for too long (which means it was never a proper grand plan in the first place). In fact, some strong players don’t believe that grand plans even exist—they view them as the creation of after-the-fact artistic license.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Nevertheless, whether one believes in grand plans or not, long plans do appear from time to time, though the extent of what the player actually saw during the game and said he saw afterward the game was over will never be known! Here’s a classic example of such a plan, by none other than the 4th World Chess Champion:</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="E.-Znosko-Borovsky---A.-Alekhine--Paris-1933"/>E. Znosko-Borovsky - A. Alekhine, Paris 1933</span></h6>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The following is what Alekhine had to say about this position (from the second book of his best games):</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">“The endgame position thus reached is by no means as easy to conduct—especially for the first player—as it looks. Black’s plan of campaign—which will prove a complete success—is divided into the following parts:</p>
			<p class="list-numbers">1) Exchange of one pair of Rooks.</p>
			<p class="list-numbers">2) Bringing the King to e6 where he will be protected from a frontal attack by the e-pawn and be used to prevent the entrance of the remaining White Rook at d7. </p>
			<p class="list-numbers">3) By operating with the Rook on the open g-file and advancing the h-pawn, force the opening of the h-file. </p>
			<p class="list-numbers">4) After this the White King—and eventually also the Bishop—will be kept busy in order to prevent the intrusion of the Black Rook at h1 or h2.</p>
			<p class="list-numbers">5) In the meantime Black, by advancing his a- and b-pawns will sooner or later succeed in opening one file on the queenside. </p>
			<p class="list-numbers">6) At that moment the White King will still be on the other wing, the first player will not dispose of sufficient forces to prevent the final intrusion of the enemy’s Rook on his first or second rank.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p">Granted that if White had, from the beginning, realized that there actually existed a danger of losing this endgame, he probably would by extremely careful defense have saved it. But as it happened, Black played with a definite plan, and White only with the conviction that the game must be a draw. And the result was a very instructive series of typical stratagems much more useful for inexperienced players than the so-called ‘brilliances.’”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The rest of the game seems a picture perfect replication of the plans Alekhine listed, but it must be admitted that White was most helpful in going along with the program: <span class="bold">16.Bh6 Rfd8 17.Kf1 f5 18.Rxd8+ Rxd8 19.g3 Kf7 20.Be3 h5 21.Ke2 Ke6 22.Rd1 Rg8 23.f3 h4 24.Bf2 hxg3 25.hxg3 Rh8 26.Bg1 Bd6 27.Kf1 Rg8 28.Bf2 b5 29.b3 a5 30.Kg2 a4 31.Rd2 axb3 32.axb3 Ra8 33.c4 Ra3 34.c5 Be7 35.Rb2 b4 36.g4 f4 37.Kf1 Ra1+ 38.Ke2 Rc1 39.Ra2 Rc3 40.Ra7 Kd7 41.Rb7 Rxb3 42.Rb8 Rb2+ 43.Kf1 b3 44.Kg1 Kc6 45.Kf1 Kd5 46.Rb7 e4 47.fxe4+ Kxe4 48.Rxc7 Kf3 49.Rxe7 Rxf2+ 50.Ke1 b2 51.Rb7 Rc2 52.c6 Kg3</span> (And not 52…Rc1+ 53.Kd2 b1=Q 54.Rxb1 Rxb1 55.c7) <span class="bold">53.c7 f3 54.Kd1 Rxc7 55.Rxb2 f2</span>, 0-1.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’d like to ask about the correct handling of positions where White has an isolated queen’s pawn. The question was raised in my head by the following game I played in a local league match, against a significantly stronger opponent.</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="Madhacker--1950----Maria-Ignacz--2200---Cardiff-vs.-Caerphilly"/>Madhacker (1950) - Maria Ignacz (2200), Cardiff vs. Caerphilly</span></h6>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">My conclusion after the game was something like, “I played d5 too early, if I had played a3 first and kicked the bishop away from b4, then played d5, it would have been much stronger because all her tactics involving …Nb4 would have been taken away, and I would have had a good game.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">However, on examination by Fritz it turns out that this was not the case and I would have been at least slightly worse anyway. I understand that White should try to liquidate the IQP by playing d5, but I never seem to get it quite right. I’d like to be able to play these positions better, so is there any advice you could give me?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Madhacker,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A very good question. Your problem is that you view the isolated d-pawn as a weakness that needs to be swapped off by a quick d4-d5. However, though this pawn is a potential static weakness, it’s also a dynamic tower of strength. If you are going to enter these kinds of positions, you need to adjust your mindset to the “It’s strong!” view rather than your negative “I have to trade the sucker off fast!” association.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In your game, 6.Nf3 is the main line, but 6.f3 (played way back in 1914) and even 6.Nge2!? Bxg2 7.Rg1 are also fairly common.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White (from a number of different openings!) usually gets the isolated d-pawn with a Knight on f3. In that case, the d-pawn gives White control over the e5-square (his f3-Knight will eventually hop there) and also gives White a central space advantage. These things, combined with moves such as Rfe1 and Bc2 followed by Qd3 give White serious chances of a kingside attack. And yes, the move d4-d5 is always on the table, but it tends to be part of white’s attacking scheme and not, as you seem to imply, a try at trading and fighting for equality.</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">Strategy for Both Sides</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, White wants to retain as much tension as possible, avoid minor piece exchanges, and either make use of his space or go directly for a kingside wipeout.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black needs to fix the d-pawn on d4 by controlling and occupying the d5-square. He has two basic ways to handle the position after this:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>He can bring pressure to bear against d4 in an effort to tie White down to its defense.</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>He can seek soothing minor piece exchanges. This gets rid of all white’s dynamic compensation and turns the pawn into a long-term static weakness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s ideal position is a Rook and Queen vs. a Rook and Queen (retaining the Queens prevents White from using his King to defend the pawn). Black will place a Rook on d5 (blocking the pawn) and put his Queen behind it—this leaves the d-pawn under enormous pressure, and often a pawn advance like …c5 or …e5 (whichever pawn he has) wins the pawn since the mutually doubled heavy pieces on either side of the d-pawn creates a pin. See the Silman - Filguth game (page 630) for an example of this.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If things go bad for White (i.e., all the minor pieces are gone), he does best to exchange all the Rooks. Then the lone Queen vs. Queen situation will be drawable since a defending Queen on c3 or e3 won’t be susceptible to pins on the d-file.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">First, let’s look at a game with a structure that was similar to the one you got in your game:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Though White can’t get a Knight to e5 like he does in most isolated d-pawn positions, he can still keep Black under pressure by retaining tension, avoiding minor piece exchanges, and aiming his guys at black’s King.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-157" class="sub-chapter1"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-7"/>The Art of Stealing Opening Ideas</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A chess professional has to do many forms of chess preparation: If he’s having trouble in endgames and technical positions, he has to do a detailed study of that phase of the game. If he finds that he often fails in sharp positions, he needs to do everything possible to iron out this flaw. And, of course, he also needs to go over all his games (especially losses) to see what he did well, and what he did poorly—once he figures out the poor part, it’s back to the grindstone in an effort to fix all his chessic ills!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Preparation is a never-ending part of a chess professional’s life, but one area that always seems to be riddled with holes is a player’s opening repertoire. No matter how hard you work on it, new moves constantly crop up from all corners of the globe that challenge your favorite lines. Thus databases and magazines need to be carefully scrutinized so that you’ll be forewarned about some hidden “bomb”, thereby preventing it from crashing down on the board and turning your favorite opening system into mush.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since theory changes minute by minute on the world stage, a player’s openings can never be as safe or as effective as he would like them to be. And, because memorizing a bunch of book lines just doesn’t cut it, a real pro needs to fortify his systems with new moves and ideas, and new interpretations of old ideas.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since staying on top of the game is a 24/7 process, a true chess professional doesn’t have much of a life outside the game. In fact, even if the hunky chess god manages to somehow score the attentions of a young lady for an evening, he’ll be so obsessed with the millions of variations swirling around in his brain that, as her lips draw close to his, he’ll be thinking, “Damn, how do I answer Kasparov’s new idea in the Sicilian? This is a nightmare! I must come up with something or I’m toast! And what about Anand’s bust to my Philidor’s Defense? I think Vishy did this to me on purpose! He’s out to get me! But what can I do about it? <span class="italic">What am I going to do</span>?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Yes, all chess professionals live in a permanent state of hysteria. And, while our dates might take that far away look in our eyes and the drool that’s pouring from the side of our mouth as the first sign of infatuation or even love, they never guess that it is indeed love/devotion/passion—but for the game, not them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since the opening workload is so enormous, and since the cutthroat world of chess is so overwhelming, every player (without exception!) has to fully embrace one of the most important and useful preparation strategies available: The art of stealing other player’s ideas!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This “stealing” comes in a few forms:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>You pay other players to come up with new stuff, and they give it to you (with a signed statement that they will never use it—it’s yours and only yours!).</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>You take other player’s recommendations and make them your own.</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>You work with other players and, hopefully, they’ll come up with some neat ideas that you can use before they do!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I remember a situation in Toronto thirty-five years ago—a famous grandmaster was playing for first place in the final round but didn’t know how to meet his opponent’s ultra sharp system in the Sicilian. Since I was known to be an opening expert in those days, he asked if I had anything interesting against this system and, when I said yes, he offered to buy it from me. So, like a drug addict and his pusher doing their business away from judgmental eyes, we consummated our unholy deal in the privacy of his room—I handed him several pages of analysis and he handed me cold, hard cash. Months later, thanks to the game he played, the line I sold him became all the rage and the pundits sang songs of praise about the grandmaster’s creative genius.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The most common way of finding a new scheme, system, or analysis is by looking for games with a strange new move—the stranger the better since most players will discount it as garbage. A serious look might convince you that it’s actually quite good, and after some work you’ll be ready to unleash it against an unsuspecting opponent. The same holds true for game annotations like, “Also interesting is 23.Nb5!?” The word <span class="italic">interesting</span> translates to, “I just thought of this so I’ll offer it as filler. Of course, I’m too lazy to see if it’s actually any good, or even if it’s playable.” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The well-trained chess pro’s eye leaps at every “also interesting” note, and tries hard to ascertain whether or not it’s legitimate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">And finally we come to my favorite opening prep technique: working with another player and, if they show me some amazing new idea, playing it as quickly as possible and claiming it as my own! There’s nothing like the look of fury on my analyst partner’s face when I use an idea he’s worked on for two years to beat a world class player in the last round for first place! After I collect my huge check, I always make a point of avoiding him for a few months until the memory of my “crime” fades. Then I’ll call him from out of the blue and see what other ideas I can wring from his fertile mind.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here are a few examples of the “stealing process” from my own games:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">While sifting through a <span class="italic">Chess Informant</span> in 1980, I noticed the following game:</p>
			<h6 class="article"><span class="bold"><a id="E.-Kuuskmaa---V.-Salceanu--correspondence-1978"/>E. Kuuskmaa - V. Salceanu, correspondence 1978</span></h6>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">My first thought was, “9.Qe2 can’t be good!” Indeed, nobody else had played it after the Kuuskmaa game. Apparently everyone had the same impression I did—that 9.Qe2 was too primitive to work. Nevertheless, I began to analyze it and, to my amazement, I decided that 9.Qe2 was not only fully playable, it was extremely strong! So, after putting many weeks of analysis into this line of the Benoni, I decided to give it a go:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This game was a last round contest for first place. A lot of money was at stake (at least, it was a lot of money for me at that time). My opponent was a very strong, solid master, so I decided to “gift” him with my little opening surprise. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I continued to play Kuuskmaa’s 9.Qe2, though it seems I was the only player in the world to do so!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Looking in my database of several million games, I noticed that (other than the Kuuskmaa contest) the earliest game mentioned was V. McCambridge - E. Lobron, Dortmund 1982! That’s right, Vince was so impressed by “my” 9.Qe2 that he stole it himself against grandmaster Lobron and scored a win! I’m sure people in Europe were saying, “McCambridge’s 9.Qe2 is pretty interesting!” Indeed, after that game the move finally became popular.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">1982 was a busy year for me, and I often analyzed with former U.S. Champion John Grefe. During one of our sessions, he showed me a new idea he had for White in the 4.f3 Nimzo-Indian.

However, Moskalenko’s discovery 8.dxe6! gives White the advantage.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What the hell? I go to the trouble of stealing this from Grefe only to have it stolen from me? Do the Russians have no shame? Even worse, they then give the following “analysis”: 8…Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qf6 10.Ne2 fxg3 11.Bg2! Qxe6 12.hxg3 Nf6 13.g4 0-0 14.g5 Ne8 15.Nf4 Qe5 16.Nd5 with a winning game for White. They didn’t just steal 8.dxe6, they also stole my entire game! Oh chess, at times you just break my heart.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In 1994 I was flitting around Eastern Europe playing in various events. While in Budapest, I spent time with English grandmaster (and chess writer extraordinaire) Peter Wells. Somehow we began talking about Kasparov and I brought up a little mystery: Why did Kasparov go into this line? Did he have something special prepared?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It turns out that Wells had pondered the same thing and set out to discover what Kasparov’s improvement was (Much later we discovered that Kasparov didn’t have an improvement and entered the whole line more or less by mistake). Wells showed me a very inventive idea for Black, but for some reason he didn’t seem to have that much faith in it. On the other hand, I continued to look at it and thought the whole line was extremely interesting. Again, luck was on my side since I arrived at Kasparov’s final position a few days later in a game against E. Anka (now a grandmaster).</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-158" class="sub-chapter1"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-6"/>Creating a Study Program</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Mr. Svorcan asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I am self-taught chess player. I have read a few books and have some chess software (Fritz, Chessmaster, etc). I play chess regularly on the net but my “real” rating is unknown, however on some websites I’m in the 1700 range. I play well against ordinary people that play for fun but have never studied chess. Anyhow, I can see that my game needs lots of improvement. Mastering the opening, planning, endgame, strategy, tactics, etc. I just don’t know how to go about this—I feel that I’m jumping from one topic to another and leaping from one book to another without ever finishing anything. In other words there is no real order to my study and no real plan of study. What should I study first, and how long should I study it? At the moment I have the time and dedication to study chess, so I was hoping you could give me some advice.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Mr. Svorcan,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’m sure a lot of readers will identify with your question. And yes, it can easily be overwhelming! Some old time players (like Capablanca) recommended that you study the endgame first, but many are bored by endgames and he failed to tell the masses just what endgames should be studied. Others say tactics, tactics, tactics. Personally, I believe in balance (a bit of everything).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, I would recommend that you keep things simple and only get one book for each area of study. For example, here’s a possible program:</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">Learn Basic Tactical Patterns</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are quite a few great books on beginning tactics, but I would recommend that you get one that teaches the most basic themes. Here are two good choices (of course, every teacher will most likely have their favorites!):</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">Winning Chess Tactics</span> by Seirawan and Silman </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">The Art of Attack in Chess</span> by Vukovic (a classic!)</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Both books are great for anyone under 1400 (lots of very basic but critically important material), while also being useful for players up to 2000 (both books also offer more challenging chapters as you work through them).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are at least a trillion books that feature tactical puzzles. Get a basic one and try to solve a problem or two (solve it from the book diagram) whenever you have a spare moment. This would be a nice complement to the two tactical theme books mentioned.</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">Create a Basic Opening Repertoire</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">FCO: Fundamental Chess Openings</span> by Paul van der Sterren</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">Modern Chess Openings</span> (<span class="italic">MCO</span>) by Nick de Firmian</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I highly recommend <span class="italic">FCO</span> as your only opening book for anyone under 1400. It gives you the plans and ideas for every opening so you can decide which ones are to your taste. Once you’re past 1400 (or ready to memorize some variations), another “everything in one volume” tome allows you to continue our “keep it simple” theme. Thus <span class="italic">MCO</span> is a good choice. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Deeper opening study should occur once you have ironed out the deficiencies in the other phases of your game. When you reach that more advanced phase, you’ll find a mindboggling amount of opening books which offer many hundreds of pages on every possible line.</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">Positional Play</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’ll be shamelessly self-serving here: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">The Amateur’s Mind</span> by Silman (for players 1000 to 1600)</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess 4</span><span class="italic">th Edition</span> by Silman (for players 1400 to 2100)</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s extremely important that the chess student creates a solid base of positional understanding that will work side by side with his tactical skills. So don’t let anyone put down this critical phase of the game!</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">The Endgame</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Okay, here I go again (forgive me!):</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="italic">Silman’s Complete Endgame Course</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If you’re a beginner to 1900, that’s all you will need. Chapters are based on rating groups. The nice thing about this book is that you should only read up to your group, or one past it. Then you can concentrate on the other areas of study (opening, tactic, positional chess).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are many fine endgame books that offer more advanced material. If you find that you love the endgame, don’t hesitate to pick up more books on this subject—<span class="italic">after</span> you become fairly well rounded in all areas of chess study.</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">In Search of a Chess Hero</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Looking over master games is always useful since one full game can give you insights into openings, the middlegame, and the endgame (the whole package!). By going over lots of games, you begin to pick up patterns that, over time, become engrained in your brain. The acquisition of chess patterns is <span class="italic">the</span> main ingredient for chess mastery.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To make this fun, pick one player (Alekhine, Capablanca, Tal, Fischer, Kasparov, Karpov, Anand, etc.) and slowly go over their (annotated) games. Another possibility is a tournament book like <span class="italic">New York 1924</span> (annotations by Alekhine). I love these things! You learn about chess history, you follow the event as if it was happening live, and you come to terms with which players bore you, and which ones really excite you—for example, Em. Lasker won NY 1924 and you might decide that he’s the ultimate chess god.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s also possible to use a database to collect all the games of your chess hero. However, a database might not give you the quality annotations that you’d find in that <span class="italic">New York 1924</span> tournament book or in a player’s “My best games of chess” collection.</p>
			<h6 class="article1"><span class="bold">Time Frames</span></h6>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I would recommend that you start with basic tactical themes. Master pins, forks, various mating patterns and whatnot (you can do this in a couple weeks, but keep it up until you really feel you are familiar with that material) and then . . . stop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Move on to the creation of an opening repertoire. Why change from opening to opening when you can put together a repertoire and learn from every disaster, every loss, and even every victory? Make sure you choose openings that suit your tastes. Thus, an all-gambit repertoire is great fun, while a positional repertoire would offer “good times” for another kind of player. <span class="italic">FCO </span>will make this “what should I play” process easy, fun, and quick.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once you have your tactical basics down and your opening repertoire primed and ready to launch, it’s time to leap into a study of positional chess. This might take a few months, but it will prove invaluable. Don’t hesitate to relax and solve various tactical puzzles during that time!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Finally, make sure your endgame IQ matches your rating. And, whenever you find yourself moving up the rating ladder, read more of that endgame book so your endgame skills are in accord with your overall strength.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After you do all this (it could take anywhere from two months to three years, depending on the amount of study time that’s available for chess), start to look at master games and/or go deeper into the topics you already studied.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ali K. asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I followed your advice about studying master games and I already can see that my planning and transition from opening to middle game is much better now, and I can actually understand the reasons behind the opening moves I had previously played just by memorization. May I ask a few more questions about the study of master games?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">1. Should I only study master games in the openings I usually play, or should I study other games too?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">2. What’s the best way to go over a game? I usually play the game on an actual board and try to understand the plan behind the moves, but I’ve seen others doing different things, like trying to guess the next move, or annotating the games, etc.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">3. Which games do you think are the best to study? Those that are annotated move-by-move (like Neil McDonald’s <span class="italic">Art of Logical Thinking</span>) or just important moves annotated (like normal games found in Magazines) or not annotated at all?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">4. I’ve got <span class="italic">ChessBase Mega Database 2007</span>, and it contains many 2200 - 2300 games along with 2700-2800 games. Considering that I’m a 1700 player, should I study those lower rated games or should I only study the super grandmasters’ games?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Mr. Ali K.,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Good questions! Actually, there’s no correct way to go over master games. Looking at (and thus absorbing) patterns is instructive no matter how you look at the moves. However, lets discuss your queries in the order they were given:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">1. “Should I only study master games in the openings I usually play, or should I study other games too?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When I was starting out, I would go over master games that featured my favorite openings if I was doing a study of a specific opening(s). On other occasions, I would look at all the games of a favorite player, or look at all the games from a specific tournament (which would feature all sorts of openings), or just start on page one of <span class="italic">Chess Informant</span> and go through everything in the book. In other words, no matter how you do it, it’s good.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">One reason that you don’t want to stick with games that only feature your openings is that you’ll miss out on ideas and structures that usually don’t occur in your chosen systems, thus limiting your ultimate growth. On the other hand, if you are making a detailed study of some opening (let’s say the Caro-Kann), then looking at 1,000 games that featured 1.e4 c6 is extremely useful since you’ll see all the best setups, setups that don’t work, correct middlegame plans, typical tactics, and also common endgames.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">2. “What’s the best way to go over a game? I usually play the game on an actual board and try to understand the plan behind the moves, but I’ve seen others doing different things, like trying to guess the next move, or annotating the games, etc.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If I want to absorb as much information as possible, as quickly as possible, from a large number of games (like the 1,000 games I mentioned in my answer to question one), I’ll use a computer board in ChessBase so I can zip through a game in five to twenty seconds. Five seconds if I realize it’s complete rubbish, and twenty seconds if I decide that it’s worth going over every move. If I find a game that I deem worthy of serious study (a new plan or move), I’ll stick it in a special database reserved for games that need independent analysis.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On the other hand, when IM John Donaldson drops by for a couple days to do some opening research, he’s already picked out the key games from ChessBase. That leaves us free to do in-depth independent analysis, which we do on a nice board and set (with Fritz and/or Rybka humming away on a laptop next to us).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Many younger players will only use a computer screen, but I prefer a real board and a nice wood set. It’s strictly a matter of taste.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If you wish to improve your powers of calculation (or see how positionally adept you are), then you should go over a game (with no notes showing) and do your best to figure out what’s going on. Write down your thoughts for each move and also write down any variations that come to mind. Afterward, look at an annotated version of that game and see how close your own impressions were to reality.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There are many reasons to go over master games, ranging from the assimilation of patterns to opening study to various forms of instruction to pure enjoyment. Each is valuable in its own way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">3. “Which games do you think are the best to study? Those that are annotated move-by-move (such as Neil McDonald’s <span class="italic">Art of Logical Thinking</span>) or just important moves annotated (like normal games found in magazines) or not annotated at all?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It depends! If I’m simply trying to absorb patterns, I go with huge numbers of games with no notes. If I’m doing a deep exploration into a specific player’s games, I much prefer to look at games annotated by that player (the more prose the better) so I can see what he was thinking about during each phase of the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">By the way, Neil’s <span class="italic">The Art of Logical Thinking</span> is an excellent book!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">4. “I’ve got <span class="italic">ChessBase Mega Database 2007</span>, and it contains many 2200 - 2300 games along with 2700-2800 games. Considering that I’m a 1700 player, should I study those lower rated games or should I only study the super grandmasters’ games?”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">When researching openings, I don’t consider games by players who are below 2300 (FIDE) to be very valuable. And if I’m looking at games for enjoyment, or games that are theoretically interesting, I’ll only go over grandmaster games or games by past greats (from 1800 to the present). However, when writing a book, I absolutely love using extremely old games, games played by beginners, on-line blitz games, and anything else that contains instructive content. In fact, games by lower rated players are often far more instructive than games by grandmasters. Why? Because the mistakes weak players make are the same mistakes my students (and most amateurs) make. Thus, these become a mirror into the student’s soul, and the games and their lessons are simply more personal than any grandmaster game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In <span class="italic">How to Reassess Your Chess, 4th Edition</span>, I use lots of games from the 17th century to the present. And I also use copious amounts of games by players from 1100 on up. It’s not unusual to see one example showing a battle between two 1400 players, the next a 400 year old struggle, and the next example a war between two 2700s played in 2009. If two earthworms played an instructive chess game, I’d make use of it! My goal is to teach, not to stick my nose in the air and proclaim that my upper-crust brain can only be fed moves blessed by grandmasters.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Sadly, many players make the huge mistake of thinking that only top grandmaster games can teach them anything. While I agree that going over lower rated games in ChessBase is a waste of time, these same games (between low rated players) can turn into gold if a caring author deconstructs them into their highly instructive components. And let’s be honest: though you might stare in wonder at a 20-move long grandmaster maneuver that leads to some obscure winning endgame, you won’t really understand it because it’s simply too advanced. But a 1200 player who misses a big chance to turn his Knight into a force of nature is something that can be readily understood, and it’s something that will help make you a far stronger player.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-160" class="sub-chapter1"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-4"/>Offering a Draw</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Doomclaw asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">When do you think is the right time to offer a draw? I have been confused by this question since I started learning about chess.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Doomclaw, </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">An interesting question! There is actually a bit of etiquette related to draw offers. For example, one should only offer a draw when it’s your move. Don’t offer it when the opponent is thinking since that could distract him and thus be construed as a deliberate shady attempt. The proper way is to make your move and then offer the draw <span class="italic">before</span> pressing your clock. Once you offer the draw, <span class="italic">then</span> press the clock. At that point the opponent can accept it at any time before he makes his move and presses his own clock. Thus: 1) Make a move; 2) Offer a draw; 3) Punch your clock.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, you can offer a draw before you move (while your clock is running), but that puts you in a strange situation since a street-smart opponent will (or should) say, “Make your move and I’ll consider it.” This means that if you make a move that forces mate in two, he can shake your hand and accept a draw. However, if you hang your face, he’ll say no and beat you. So for your own protection, think hard about your move, play what you feel is the best in the position, and only then make your offer, after which you can press your clock.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s also considered to be “bad form” if you offer a draw to a far stronger player. The idea is that if the superior player wanted a draw, he would ask you for it. So, if you are rated 1800 and are paired with a grandmaster, you really shouldn’t make any offer—if you’re winning, why chicken out and offer a draw? If it’s equal, play chess and if the chess god you’re facing wants a draw he’ll offer it to you (trust me, he knows you want a draw—it’s not a secret!). If you’re worse and offer a draw to a far superior opponent, it amounts to an insult and a deliberate attempt to bother him. Perhaps you were hoping to go over the game with him afterwards. Making an insult offer like that will only ensure that he will refuse any attempts at a postmortem.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, I tell my students to never offer a draw unless there’s simply nothing left in the position, and to never accept a draw unless the board is devoid of play or if they are seriously worse. It doesn’t matter if they are playing Kasparov, accepting a draw means they will miss out on an important learning experience. The fact is, a player that fights to the bitter end becomes feared, with even higher rated players knowing such an opponent has no respect for anyone and will take you to the brink each and every time he sits down. 

</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I remember hearing about a simultaneous exhibition given by Spassky (I think he was playing somewhere in the area of forty to fifty people). After about ten moves, one of Spassky’s opponents offered a draw. Spassky, who was delighted, happily shook the guy’s hand and said, “Good game!”

 </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Suddenly hysteria broke out! Everyone started offering draws and Spassky happily accepted—he was being well paid, and if these misguided individuals wanted to throw away a rare chance to play the World Champion (ten book moves isn’t playing), then why should he care? He was just happy to have a quick night.

</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Something similar occurred with Kasparov, who was giving a small clock simultaneous against a handful of the most talented young players in the U.S. One guy pounded out a few books moves and then forced a well-known repetition, thus getting a quick draw. Afterwards Kasparov criticized his opponent, telling him that this wasn’t even a game, and that he might never get the chance to play Kasparov again. In other words, the guy threw away a huge learning experience (nobody will care when you say, “Look, I played eight book moves and then shook hands with Karparov.”).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There are also quite a few draw-offer oddities. Here are three typical cases:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>I saw one game where White offered Black a draw. Black thought about it for fifty minutes, leaving himself only twenty seconds on the clock. He then said, “Okay, I accept!” and reached out to shake hands. White replied, “You accept what?” Black: “You offered a draw!” White: “I never offered a draw!” Fortunately for the guy playing Black, I witnessed the very clear draw offer, and told the director that White was a scumbag. Black, of course, got his draw.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Decades ago, one famous grandmaster would often ask his opponents, “Are you playing for a draw?” If they replied, “Yes, I accept your offer!” he would say, “Oh no! I didn’t offer a draw, I just wanted to know if you were playing for one!”</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>I’ve had many games where a far weaker opponent offered me several draws during a game. In one sense I don’t mind this, since he’s (in effect) offering me draw odds on top of the fact that I’m a higher rated player. In some cases I would push too hard to win against such an opponent, and, when I realized that I had committed suicide, I’d offer the draw. Then, without any thought, his hand would leap out and shake mine. Don’t let this happen to you! Don’t offer draws, and always play to beat anyone of any rating!</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Unknown asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">What do you think is the best food to be eaten during a big tournament?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Unknown,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Actually, this is quite an interesting question! Of course, people eat all sorts of garbage before an event, but should that change during it? I think the answer depends on the individual. Do you have blood sugar problems? Do you find that you can’t think as well after a large meal? Or, are you more or less the same no matter what you consume?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Long ago, grandmaster Walter Browne used to insist that he would happily buy his opponent a huge steak dinner right before their game. Why? Because he felt all the blood would leave the brain and go to the stomach, making it impossible for the other guy to think clearly.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Grandmaster Gligoric would eat chocolate throughout his games, while Fischer would sip apple juice. In the 1800s, top players would often bring a bottle of booze with them to the board and empty it during play. That doesn’t happen anymore, but many grandmasters and international masters get completely drunk after a game—often staying out all night at the local bar and somehow appearing the next day fresh and strong. Of course, not all alcohol-loving players would drink after the game—there are many cases of titled players drinking before the game and appearing at the board in a state of near coma.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the 60s and early 70s, some players gave drugs a try during tournament games. In general, LSD didn’t work out too well for them (an unnamed IM wasn’t able to make even one move, sitting there watching dinosaurs fly through the air until his flag fell on move one). Others gave pot a try (in fact, many players used it before, during, and after play!), others speed, and others opium. Times were quite different then, especially when you consider that too much caffeine is now a FIDE offense, and if you’re caught a couple times imbibing too many cups, you can be banned for a few years. That’s quite a huge leap from the “Exploration Uber Alles” mentality of the 60s!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Personally, I always had a serious sensitivity to sugar, and this more or less destroyed my career since I never made proper adjustments to the problem. In my youth, I would toss down chocolate bars during play, but would start falling asleep as the game progressed. I actually found myself waking up in several games with twenty to forty minutes having ticked off my clock! Later I would try juice, but even that level of sugar wiped me out and led to endless blunders as my brain melted and vision blurred. I only cured the problem in my final couple of tournament years—I brought a high-grade ginseng root to the board and sucked on it all through the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Ultimately, you have to figure out what’s right for your body. Knowing which foods and beverages work for you is extremely important. And, if you find coffee wakes you up and allows you to play at your usual level, or if cough syrup (banned by FIDE) is needed so you don’t cough and disturb your opponent—go for it. Last I heard, coffee and over the counter cough syrup are legal in the real world—and personally, I would love it if my opponent glugged down forty cups of java. I can’t understand why any chess organization has a say in such things.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Anonymous asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I thought chess was supposed to be a gentleman’s game, but at times my opponents act rudely during tournament play. What can I do about this?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Anonymous,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">During a tournament in Los Angeles, two players got into a fight while playing and began stabbing each other with their pens. This is probably not a good way to deal with a rude opponent. In fact, the only correct thing to do when an unruly imbecile is sitting opposite you is to find the tournament director and ask him to put an end to your opponent’s deplorable behavior before it escalates into something like the aforementioned duel.

</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Rude and/or crazy behavior is a time-honored part of the game. The 16th Century Spanish priest and chess player Ruy Lopez de Segura recommended that, when playing outside, you should always face your opponent toward the sun so he will be unable to see the whole board through his permanent squint.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I’ve personally faced players who covered the whole spectrum of bizarre behavior: one guy would whistle a song (his tone would get more dominating if he felt he was doing well, and it would taper off into a beaten, pathetic drone if he was losing), another would mumble, an old man made disgusting gagging sounds from the first move to the last, another old man kept saying, “Go get the body! Go get the body!” over and over, and one guy who appeared to have a bird’s nest on his head kept picking at it, popping whatever he had gotten from the nest into his mouth.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">

Here are a few more that I’ve faced, all of which are 100% true:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A famous IM used to empty one of those huge plastic coke bottles and fill it with tequila. He’d keep it on the table, ready for use in case of an “emergency.” His philosophy was, if something unpleasant happens on the board, take several deep glugs directly from the bottle and drink your worries away. He tried this on me once, emptied the bottle, and ended up with his face literally lying flat on the table. When it was his turn to move, his hand would rise up blindly, grope for a piece to move, and then (after pushing some piece somewhere) fall limply back to the ground. After he hung all his pieces, he quietly resigned and stumbled out of the hall.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>I first experienced this one while playing a well-known chess politician. After I made a move that my esteemed opponent felt was annoying, he slowly took a sandwich out of his backpack, carefully unwrapped it, and then took huge, loud bites—chomping sickeningly as if he was a lion eating human flesh. Once the sandwich was consumed, he then made eye contact with me, smiled, calmly reached into his pocket, and took out some dental floss. Then he flossed away, bits of sandwich flying all over the board.</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Many decades ago, I was teaching a fourteen-year-old girl who was all the rage. She did TV interviews, was big with celebrities, and was considered to be the next big chess thing by many pundits. While watching her play a tournament game, she hung a piece and, shockingly, quickly wrote a letter and handed it to her opponent under the table. It said, “Please don’t take my piece. My father will beat me if you do!”</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>When things have gone badly and it’s time to resign, some players have a final bit of fun by making use of creative ways to give up. Alekhine once threw his King across the room in disgust, while Nimzovich (against Saemisch) stood on the table (and by some accounts got down on his knees) and shouted, “Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!”—“Must I lose against these idiots!”</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Finally, while playing an event in London, an opponent of mine found a far calmer way to end the game—he simply pushed all the pieces off the board and onto my lap, and then got up and walked out of the tournament hall.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Rambaldi23 asked:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I have a question regarding teaching chess. I’m very interested in giving students/beginners private lessons and originally felt it most appropriate to wait until I achieve an expert rating, but I really have the urge to teach now. Right now I’m in the 1700s USCF and my rating is on an upward spiral. I feel I can certainly help beginners/young kids with the basics, develop an opening repertoire, tactics, etc. In addition, I am a public school teacher by day so I have plenty of experience working with kids. My thinking is that once the student achieves a class C rating, the parent can decide if he/she should then study with someone higher rated.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Do you feel it’s appropriate for me to take on young students/beginners interested in entering tournament chess (or hobbyists), or am I correct that it’s really not appropriate until I’m an expert? I value your input very much. There seems to be conflicting opinions on this.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Dear Rambaldi23,</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Conflicting opinions? Well, there are always conflicting opinions among people that don’t have a clue, so try to discount those that couldn’t teach a dog to bark but love to speak, and strong players who love to put themselves on a pedestal. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If you look at the various scholastic programs, you’ll find that the vast majority of teachers are in the 1400 - 1700 range. And, that’s perfect for kids (rating wise).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">When you want to teach children, there are a couple things that are far more important than a player’s rating:</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Do you have the patience to teach young children?</p>
			<p class="list-1-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Are you a natural born teacher, able to communicate in a simple, clear, and entertaining fashion?</p>
			<p class="list-1-lastline-style"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Do children feel comfortable around you?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s also important to understand one great truth: a high rating (expert, master, or even grandmaster) doesn’t mean a person can successfully share his knowledge. It doesn’t mean he can write. And it doesn’t mean he can teach. Teaching calls for a specific skill-set, and teaching children calls for a skill-set all its own!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I remember a gentleman in the San Francisco Bay Area who was “only” rated 1500, yet he taught chess for years at a junior college (he might still be at it!) and was widely respected as a very, very good teacher. Even players who were considerably higher rated than he was attended his classes. In fact, I attended one of his classes and was very impressed!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So, your thought about having to be an Expert before you teach is simply wrong. Trust me when I say that you already have the goods: experience with children, experience with teaching, and a solid 1700 rating. And lest I forget, it also seems that you have a passion for it—a real desire to share your love of chess with young people. Sounds to me like you’re a natural.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Get out there and teach! And don’t let anyone tell you differently!</p>
