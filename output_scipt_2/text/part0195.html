			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A very famous game. The position is quite interesting. The main features are the opposite colored Bishops, white’s two passed center pawns, and black’s kingside pawn majority. At the moment white’s center pawns are frozen in place. Black’s kingside majority is chugging along, but the advances have left various weaknesses in their wake. Most pronounced (at least to my eye) is the sad situation of white’s Bishop—the poor thing has been relegated to Tall-Pawn status. As we know, if you have such a Bishop, you need to either get it outside the pawn chain (thus making it active) or get the blocking pawns out of its way. These goals can be actualized by positional or tactical means.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">On the other hand, black’s Bishop looks very nice! If he is able to create a permanent blockage on both e6 and d5 (for example, his Knight on e6, Queen on d7, and Bishop on d5) then he’ll enjoy a significant advantage.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So which Bishop will be the hero? Since it’s White to move, it’s his job to <span class="italic">insist </span>that his Bishop rules the day. Because the black King is sitting on the same diagonal as white’s Bishop, it’s clear that a transformation from Tall-Pawn to monster would occur if those pawns were to suddenly vanish. Capablanca, then only twelve-years old, probably understood all this information in an instant. Then he uncorked one of his most memorable combinations.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you realized that the Bishop on b2 was a serious problem, and if you noticed the potential along the a1-h8 diagonal, and if you then did everything you could to rectify it, we can say you did very well. The rest of the solution is all about advanced tactics—but tactics that serve to make white’s strategic dreams come true.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e6!! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The e-pawn sacrifices itself in an effort to clear the central dark squares and activate its Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Another, far simpler, win was 1.Qc4! Be6 2.Qxd5 Bxd5 3.e6 when black’s position falls apart (due, of course, to the opening of the a1-h8 diagonal). For example: 3…Nh6 4.Re5 Rad8 5.e7, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Bb5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">1…Bxe6 loses instantly to 2.Rxe6 when 2…Qxe6 3.d5+ picks up black’s Queen.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Qxb5!! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Sacrificing the Queen and removing the blockader on d5. This allows the final dark square blockage to be removed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White doesn’t have to play in this manner (but who could resist giving up the Queen?). Just 2.Qd2 does the trick: 2…Nd8 3.Re5 and the a1-h8 once again turns into a fast track freeway for the b2-Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The point of all these methods (1.e6 or 1.Qc4, 2.Qxb5 or 2.Qd2—two positional methods and two tactical ones) is the same: to bust up black’s blockade of the d4-pawn and rip open the a1-h8 diagonal for the b2-Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Qxb5 3.d5+ Rg7 4.exf7 h6</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">4…Rf8 5.Nxg5 is completely devastating.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb"><span class="bold">5.Nd4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A very human move—it feels natural, gains time by hitting the Queen, and also seems (and is) extremely strong. Yet, it’s not the most accurate. Instead, the counterintuitive 5.Nh4! (retaining the pin along the a1-h8 diagonal) is the way to go: 5…Kh7 (5…gxh4 6.Rg1) 6.Bxg7 gxh4 7.f8=Q Rxf8 8.Bxf8 Qxd5 9.Rg1 Qd2+ 10.Kh1 Qd3 11.Rg2 Qxh3+ 12.Kg1 and white’s two Rooks and Bishop (not to mention the attack against black’s King) easily overpowers black’s lone Queen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Qxf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Capablanca’s analysis vs. 5…Qd7 goes as follows: 6.Nxf5 Qxf7 7.Bxg7+ Kh7 8.Re7 Qxd5 9.Be5+ Kg6 10.Rg7+ Kh5 11.Ng3+ Kh4 12.Rf4+ gxf4 13.Rg4 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">6.Rxf1 Rxf7 7.Rxf5 Rxf5 8.Nxf5+ Kh7 9.Ne7!  </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Killing the King and also depriving black’s Rook access to the c-file. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Rf8 10.Kg2 h5 11.d6 g4 12.hxg4 hxg4 13.Be5 Kh6 14.d7 Rd8 15.Ng8+ Rxg8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Even worse is 15…Kg6 16.Nf6 Kf7 17.Bc7. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Bf6 </span>White’s now a piece up. The rest was easy:<span class="bold"> 16…Kg6 17.d8=Q Rxd8 18.Bxd8 b5 19.Kf2 Kf5 20.Ke3 Ke5 21.Kd3 Kd5 22.Kc3 g3 23.Bh4 g2 24.Bf2 a5 25.b4 Ke4 26.Bb6 Kd5 27.Kd3 Kc6 28.Bg1 Kd5 29.Bh2 Kc6 30.Kd4 a4 31.Ke5 Kb6 32.Kd5 Ka6 33.Kc5 </span>(Not falling for 33.Kc6?? g1=Q 34.Bxg1 stalemate), 1-0.</p>
