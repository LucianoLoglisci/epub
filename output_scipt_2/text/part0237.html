			<p class="caption3">Black just played 23…g6-g5; did that make sense or did he go berserk? How should White respond?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 d6 5.Nf3 0–0 6.Nc3 Nbd7 7.0–0 e5 8.e4 exd4 9.Nxd4 Re8 10.h3 a6 11.Be3 Rb8 12.a4 Nc5 13.Qc2 a5 14.Rad1 Bd7 15.Ndb5 b6 16.Rfe1 h6 17.f4 Bxb5 18.axb5 Qe7 19.Bf2 Qf8 20.Kh2 h5 21.Bxc5 bxc5 22.Ra1 h4 23.g4 g5</span> - Diagram 200</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After 23.g4 Black, seeing that his a5-pawn was toast, decided to play for a “Hail Mary” and gave 23...g5 a shot. Against best play this move actually hastens his demise (23…Nd7 was more resilient, when the …g5 idea might come at a better moment), but Mr. Russell deserves credit for it nonetheless—by offering a pawn Black hopes to gain several positional trumps and, ideally, a bit of counterplay.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The move also has some psychological impact. International Master Anthony Saidy, an American chess legend, was feeling very confident—he had completely outplayed his lower rated opponent and expected a trouble free victory. When 23…g5 was played, I can imagine Dr. Saidy refusing to give the move any credit at all. On the other hand, Black had already put his poor opening play behind him and had announced to his opponent that, “I don’t intend to go quietly into that dark night!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So what’s good about 23…g5? A glance at the position after 23.g4 will tell you that White has much more space and he’s about to eat a free pawn (a5). On the other side of the board, it’s hard to see where black’s play is coming from—none of his pieces have any advanced squares to call their own. With that in mind, one can begin to understand the point of the 23…g5 pawn sacrifice: after 24.fxg5 Nh7 the Knight will take up residence on g5, the Bishop will rule the board on e5, and the dark-squares around white’s King are suddenly severely weakened. In other words, even though Black might be clearly worse after 23…g5 24.fxg5, his pieces will find some activity and he’ll have some imbalances that he can be proud of.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you saw what Black was after, and if you were macho (and wise) enough to deprive him of his hoped for positional/dynamic trumps, then you should feel really good about yourself. Though I started the spread at 1800, if those in the lower rating groups also got on top of this problem, then expect a rapid rise up the rating ladder! Of course, you shouldn’t feel any shame if you didn’t solve it since Saidy himself failed to do so in the actual game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So a subtle psychological shift had occurred, and White didn’t catch it. In the actual game Saidy chopped on g5, missed several big chances, and ultimately fell victim to his dark-squared weaknesses: 24.fxg5 Nh7 25.Nd5 Be5+ 26.Kh1 Rbc8 27.Rxa5 Nxg5 28.Ra7 Ne6 29.Rf1 Ra8 30.Rxa8 Rxa8 31.Qf2 Bg3 32.Nf6+ Kh8 33.Qf5 Qh6 34.Nh5? (34.e5! was very strong, opening the h1-a8 diagonal for the white’s Bishop and also giving white’s Knight access to the e4-square) 34…Be5 35.Qf2 Ng5 36.Qxh4 Ra2 37.Rb1 Kg8 38.Qf2 Qg6 39.Qc2 Kf8 40.Qb3 Ra8 41.Re1 Ne6 42.Rf1 Nd4 43.Qe3 Ra2 44.Rb1 Ne6 45.Qb3 Ra8 46.Ng3 Qg5 47.Nf1 Qh4 48.Qe3 Ra2 49.Qe1 Qxe1 50.Rxe1 Rxb2 51.Rd1 Nf4 52.Rd2 Rb1 53.Rc2 Re1 54.Kg1 Bd4+ 55.Kh2 Ne2 56.Bf3 Be5+ 57.Kg2 Nf4+ 58.Kf2 Nd3+ 59.Kg2 Ra1 60.Re2 Nf4+ 61.Kf2 Nxe2 62.Bxe2 Ra2 63.Kf3 Ke7 64.Bd1 Ra3+ 65.Ke2 Bf4, 0-1. So Black was in trouble all the way through, but he had some weapons (the weapons he created with 23…g5) and, after various white mistakes, they came through for him.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though 24.fxg5 retains a significant plus, White should have asked himself, “Why should I give my opponent anything of worth? Why does he deserve all that dark-square control? Why does he deserve any piece activity? Is there any way I can stomp this guy into jelly?” In fact, throwing in a “Kill!” wouldn’t have hurt either!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">If Saidy had held this dialogue with himself, he wouldn’t have had any trouble finding a far better move:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.e5!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now <span class="italic">this</span> is a macho move!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…dxe5</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">No better is 24…Nd7 25.Bc6 Red8 26.Qf5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">25.fxg5 Nh7</span> - see diagram 200aDo you see the difference between this position and the position that occurred in the game (via 24.fxg5 Nh7)? In the game position Black had access to the e5-square, his Bishop was very active, and white’s Bishop was a horrible piece. By inserting 24.e5 dxe5 we’ve changed all that: now black’s Bishop is dead, black’s pieces don’t have access to e5, white’s Bishop rules the wide open h1-a8 diagonal, white’s Knight has access to e4, and white’s Queen is on a fast track to f5. By playing 24.e5 White deprived Black of everything he dreamed of getting while adding to his own already large list of advantages.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb"><span class="bold">26.Qf5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Placing the Queen on a powerful square, defending g5, and threatening Be4. Also very strong was 26.g6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Qe7 27.Bc6 Red8 28.Ne4</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has achieved a fairytale position: almost all of his pieces are ideally placed, all of black’s pieces are unemployed, and the light-square blockade is a wonder to behold. If we add that black’s pawns are weak and his King can easily fall to a mating attack (White can play Rf1 followed by Nf6+), one can see just how hopeless black’s cause is.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">To sum up: in the actual game White made his opponent happy with 24.fxg5 because it gave him a few stones to throw (meaning, it gave him hope). On the other hand, 24.e5 would have immediately deflated his opponent’s dreams and left him with nothing but the misery of a passive, hopeless defense.</p>
