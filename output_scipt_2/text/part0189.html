			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black just moved his Knight to f8 and clearly intends to play 13…Ne6 when it will be able to leap into d4 or f4. </p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The right move can be arrived at in different ways. For example, if you simply wanted to gain space, then d5 is it. Or, if you were worried about …exd4, then once again d5 is the move. However, I am hoping that you noticed …Ne6 and played d5 in a deliberate attempt to stuff the enemy Knight!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White now played <span class="bold">13.d5</span> because he intended to begin an attack by h2-h4-h5 and the center needs to be closed to make this worthwhile—he also wanted to stop the f8-Knight from finding fame and fortune on e6. In other words, he used the advance of his d-pawn to dominate the enemy Knight and force it to remain on a purely defensive square. After <span class="bold">13…N6d7 14.h4</span> White had a clear advantage and went on to win.</p>
