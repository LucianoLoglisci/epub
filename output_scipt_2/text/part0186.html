			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position occurred in the game <a id="J.-Silman---S.-Booth--Los-Angeles-1987"/>J. Silman - S. Booth, Los Angeles 1987. Both sides have vulnerable queenside pawns (a6 for Black and b2 for White), but white’s more active minor pieces and advantage in central space (which leaves Black constantly worrying about both f4-f5 and e4-e5 advances) gives him the better chances. At the moment the pride of white’s position is the c4-Knight, but Black would love to exchange it for his far less imposing beast on d7 (via …Nb6). When you look at the position in this fashion, white’s first move shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Though you might be getting used to Knight retreats by now, the solution is obscured by central possibilities, and chances to create pressure against a6. Also, White already has a Knight on c4, so why bring the other Knight to bear on that same square? Clearly, there’s a lot more going on than a simple Knight retreat, and that’s what makes it an advanced problem.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Nb1! Nb6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black would love to play 1…f5, but it fails to 2.exf5 Rxe1 3.Bxe1 Nxf5 4.Bxb4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Nbd2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Mission accomplished, White retains an Octopus on c4. And why is the Octopus so strong on that square? A glance shows that its many arms reach in all directions: of course, it eyes internal squares on a3, d2, and e3, but that’s to be expected. It turns into a superhero when one realizes that it defends the pawn on b2, eyes a5 (which can be a jumping off point to c6 via Nc4-a5-c6—this also means that when White starts attacking the a-pawn with Ra1, Black won’t want to push the pawn to a5 since that would walk right into the Knight’s influence.), eyes b6, puts serious pressure on d6, and also takes a swing at e5 (this prepares for white’s thematic e4-e5 push or, if f4-f5 is played, Mr. Octopus keeps the hole on e5 from becoming terminal).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2…Nxc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This only helps White. Though 2…Qb8 3.Na5! Rxb2 4.Rb1 is seriously annoying, and though 2…f5 3.e5! is even worse, the tight 2…Nf7 would have done more to keep white’s advantage within acceptable limits.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Nxc4 Nf7 4.Ra1 Qb7?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Things get out of hand after this. He had to try 4…Qe7 when 5.Rfe1 takes the e1-square away from white’s Bishop. Then 5…Qd7 followed by …Qb5 keeps Black in the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.Be1 Rb5 6.Bc3 Qe7 7.Rfe1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s now strategically lost. He has no active play, his pieces are passive, his d6-pawn is in need of constant defense, and his a6-pawn is, ultimately, a goner.</p>
