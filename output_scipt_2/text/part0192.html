			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black’s a solid pawn up. However, we already know that a one-pawn advantage doesn’t guarantee victory when Bishops of opposite colors are on the board. Thus, Black will want to retain as many pieces as possible and show that his Bishop is a strong attacker that can go after things the other Bishop can’t defend. To this end, control of d4 is critical since, from there, the Bishop will eye f2 while also blocking off the d-file. Note that the extra pawn allows black’s Bishop to safely reside on d4, while white’s Bishop doesn’t have the same luxury. Ultimately, the extra pawn, superior Bishop, and iron control of the e-file should combine to give Black a winning game.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The material advantage and black’s control of the e-file is obvious, so that leaves black’s grip on d4 as a major thing to notice. This is fully in a 1400’s range.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21…Bd4 22.a4 b6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s in no hurry since White can’t do anything (he has no targets to attack in black’s position and no means to effect any useful penetration) but wait and hope that his opponent doesn’t find a way to break through. When your opponent is helpless, it’s always a good idea to tighten up your position. 22…b6 takes the pawn away from the white Bishop’s stare and also gives extra support to c5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.b3 Re5 24.Rd2 h5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This little pawn move is designed to create new weaknesses in white’s kingside.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Re2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is trying to trade everything he can in an effort to reach a pure Bishop of opposite colors endgame. Even though he’s a pawn down, he would have real chances to hold such a situation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Rxe2 26.Bxe2 h4 27.Kh1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White isn’t in any hurry to stop black’s h-pawn with 27.h3 since that would leave a severe weakness along the h2-b8 diagonal. Black would try to make decisive use of this with 27…Qf4 and, if allowed, …Be5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">27…Qf4 28.g3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A weakness has been provoked and white’s King will soon find itself facing more than a bit of heat.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">28…Qf6 29.Qd1 Rd8</span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Can White handle the heat?</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30.Bg4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White cracks under the pressure. A better defense was 30.Qd3 (hoping to cover the h1-a8 diagonal and also offer an exchange of Queens with Qf3), though White would still face a long, miserable slog. On the other hand, the natural looking 30.Kg2 is simply bad: 30…Bc3 31.Bd3 Qc6+ 32.f3 h3+ 33.Kh1 (33.Kxh3 Qd7+ 34.Kg2 Qxd3) 33…Qd6 34.Be2 Qe7 35.Qc2 Rd2 36.Qxc3 Qxe2 mates.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30…Bxf2! 31.Qe2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now it’s easy. He had to try 31.Qf3 Qxf3+ 32.Bxf3 when white is two pawns down but he can still make use of the opposite colored Bishops to put up a fight.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31…Rd2! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White probably missed this. Now 32.Qxd2 Qc6+ mates.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">32.Qe8+ Kg7 33.gxh4 Qd4 34.Bh3 Qd3 35.Bg2 Rd1</span>, 0-1. After 36.Qb5 Rxf1+ 37.Bxf1 Qe4+ 38.Bg2 Qxh4 Black would be two pawns up while also retaining serious play against the vulnerable enemy King.</p>
