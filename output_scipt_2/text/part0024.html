			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is considered <span class="bold-italic">Active</span> if it’s outside the pawn chain and/or enjoying life on a reasonably clutter-free diagonal.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is considered <span class="bold-italic">Useful</span> if it’s doing an important (defensive or dynamic) task(s). Such a defensive Bishop can be ugly to look at, but its absence would cause your position to undergo serious difficulties.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A Bishop is said to be a <span class="bold-italic">Tall-Pawn</span> if it’s not serving a useful function and is trapped behind its pawns (thus making it inactive). This kind of Bishop takes on the persona of an overgrown pawn that, sadly, can’t turn into a Queen if it reaches the end of the board.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Bishops are usually strongest in open positions. The fewer pawns in the way of a Bishop the greater its scope.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Every time you move a pawn, check to see how it affects the activity of your Bishops! Obviously, turning an open position into a closed one will have a serious effect on these pieces, so train yourself to always take the health and care of your Bishops into account.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>While an active Bishop might look good, a useful Bishop trades style for substance and addresses the deeper needs (both dynamic and defensive) of a position.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Always think twice before placing your pawns on the same color as your Bishop! In general, you should only do this if your Bishop can get outside the pawn chain (which would make it active), or if your Bishop is proving useful (most likely as a defender) inside the chain.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you have a Tall-Pawn, try to free it by getting the pawns off its color or by getting it outside the pawn chain. Failing those things, you can also try and exchange it for an enemy minor piece (thus following our “trade bad pieces for good ones” rule).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>All the knowledge and good intentions in the world won’t stop you from ending up with a Tall-Pawn from time to time. If this occurs, you need to:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Get your pawns off the color of your Bishop (unblocking it).</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Get your Bishop outside the pawn chain.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Exchange the horrible Bishop for an enemy Bishop or Knight.</p>
