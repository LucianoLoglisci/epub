			<p class="caption3">Assess the position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.a3 Bxc3+ 5.bxc3 0–0 6.f3 b6 7.e4 Ne8 8.Be3 Ba6 9.Bd3 Nc6 10.Ne2 Na5</span> - Diagram 287</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White didn’t play the opening with enough panache and c4 is about to fall. Since 11.0-0 Bxc4 isn’t going to offer enough compensation for the pawn, he needs to look elsewhere in an effort to generate some kind of dynamism in exchange for his inferior structure.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I would expect most players to notice that the c4-pawn is hanging. However, some might just shrug their shoulders and give it up (without getting much compensation) while others might vainly try to hold onto it with 11.Qa4, without bothering to see how Black would respond. A solid 1400 player should notice these things and realize that White doesn’t really have much choice—it’s either 11.c5 or bust! Of course, the prospect of ending up with doubled isolated c-pawns (via 12…bxc5) could easily spook him!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I would considerably raise the rating-bar for black’s play—fighting the desire to double white’s pawns on move 12 would be tough, and 12…d6 followed by taking away from the center breaks an age-old rule (“always capture towards the center”).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.c5! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not ideal, but best. Far worse is 11.Qa4? d5 when the c4-pawn is lost and white’s Queen move proved to be a waste of time.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11…Bxd3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">An important and welcome exchange. Black removes one of white’s best attacking pieces, which, after an eventual e4-e5, would exert annoying pressure against black’s kingside.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">12.Qxd3 d6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black is trying to saddle White with a structural disadvantage <span class="italic">without</span> dynamic counter chances. During the game I wasn’t sold on 12…bxc5 13.dxc5 d5 14.exd5 (Better than 14.e5 Qh4+ 15.Bf2 Qc4, which favors Black) 14…Nf6 15.Qb5 Nxd5 16.Bf2 c6 17.Qa4 since black’s Knights don’t have permanent perches and, in some lines, the d6-square can fall into white’s hand after Ne2-g3-e4-d6 (also, chasing the d5-Knight off the d-file with c3-c4, and then following with Rd1-d6 is also possible).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.cxb6 cxb6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">13…axb6 was a thought, but by opening the c-file I was intending to make the c4-square my own and to place serious pressure against c3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Now White has to make an important decision.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.0–0? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Chess teachers are always imploring their students to castle, yet here’s a case where that same teacher would respond—upon seeing a student that expected praise for finally getting his King to safety—“Why did you castle here? It’s clearly wrong!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This natural but lazy move, played by a very experienced master, is an error because it doesn’t address the fight over c4. This one loss of tempo assures Black victory in that battle. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Correct was 14.c4, not allowing the c-pawn to be fixed on c3 and thus turning it into both a target and a dynamic force (in the best Static vs. Dynamic tradition). Play might continue: 14…Qc8 15.Rc1 Qa6 16.Bd2 (16.Nf4 Nf6 17.c5 Qxd3 18.Nxd3 bxc5 19.dxc5 d5 20.e5 [20.0–0 dxe4 21.fxe4 Rfc8 22.Ne5 Rc7, =] 20…Nd7 21.c6 Nb6 22.c7 Rfc8 and the pawn has gone too far!) 16…Rc8 17.Bxa5 Qxa5+ 18.Kf2 Nf6 19.Qb3 Rc6, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After 14.0-0, the rest of the game saw Black dominate c4, snuff out all enemy counterplay, and infiltrate on the queenside and central light squares: <span class="bold">14…Qc7 15.Bg5 Rc8 16.f4 f6 17.Bh4 Qc4 18.Qe3 d5 19.e5 f5 20.Kh1 Qa4 21.h3 Qc2 22.Rfc1 Qe4 23.Qxe4 dxe4 24.d5 </span>(A desperate bid for activity. The idea of waiting around while the a5-Knight made a home on c4 and the e8-Knight claimed d5 via …Ne8-c7-d5 couldn’t have appealed to him!)<span class="bold"> 24…exd5 25.Nd4 g6 26.Rab1 Nc7 27.Be7 Rfe8 28.Bb4 Nc4 29.Nc6 Ne6! </span>(Sacrificing the Exchange for an armada of pawns and total domination of the position.)<span class="bold"> 30.Ne7+ Rxe7 31.Bxe7 Nxf4 32.Rd1 Kf7 33.Bd6 Nd3 </span>(Knights don’t get much better than this!)<span class="bold"> 34.Kg1 Ke6 35.a4 Ndb2 36.Rd4 Nxa4 37.Rb4 Nxc3 38.Kf2 a5 39.Rdxc4 dxc4 40.Rxb6 Nd5 41.Ra6 c3 42.Ba3+ Kxe5</span>, 0-1.</p>
