			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A glance gives the impression that White is doing very well. He’s ahead in development, he is threatening to capture the pawn on f5, and his King seems safer than black’s. And … all this is true! What can Black do to change his apparent inferiority?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The problem is that no “normal” move will stop the pain:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">1…Qf6 2.g4! (2.Bxf5!?) 2…e4 3.Be2! (3.Bxe4!? is also interesting) 3…Qg6 (3…exf3 4.Nxf3 Qe7 5.Bg5 Bf6 6.Bxf6 Nhxf6 7.gxf5 also favors White) 4.Kh1 exf3 5.Nxf3 fxg4 6.Bd3 is unpleasant for Black—after all, the better developed side (White) is usually very happy if the position opens up. Note that after 6.Bd3 Qe8 7.Bxh7+ Kh8 8.Ng5 Qxe3? gets mated by 9.Rxf8+ Bxf8 10.Nf7+ Kg7 11.Qg6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">1…f4?? hangs the pawn on h7, but even if that pawn was safe on h6 this push to f4 would still be a mistake since it hands the e4-square to White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Both 1…Nb8 and 1…Nb6 are typical computer “hold everything together no matter how ugly it is” moves. Yes, they do give f5 some badly needed support, but they aren’t fighting for any gains, just survival!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: Actually, the correct move would be played by anyone who has been introduced to the idea in the past. It’s a very common tactical device in the King’s Indian Defense. However, if Black doesn’t know it, I would expect it would be fairly hard to find.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">1...e4! 2.fxe4 f4 3.Bf2 Ne5 4.Be2 Qg5 5.Nf3 Nxf3+ 6.Bxf3 Be5</span> (6…Bg4!?) and suddenly Black has much to boast about: his ownership of the e5-square turns any piece that lives there into a monster, the open g-file can easily grant Black an attack once a black Rook makes it way to g8 or g7, White must always be careful not to allow the f4-pawn to step forward to f3 where it might succeed in dismantling the white King, and the extra white pawn on e4 is a traitor since it kills the previously active white Queen and light-squared Bishop, while also depriving the c3-Knight of the use of the e4-square.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black didn’t wait to see if something nice happened to him with a move like 1…Nb8, instead he <span class="italic">made</span> something nice happen—he created a litany of positive imbalances where none existed before.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In situations of this type (where everything seems to be against you), if a pawn sacrifice like this appears, you have to play it even if it is still a bit better for the opponent (of course, I’m not saying that Black is worse here in any way, shape, or form). Why? Because being a bit worse with <span class="italic">no play</span> rarely ends well. But being a bit worse (and does anyone really care about “- 0.20” anyway?) with lots of play means that all three possible results are still actively “on.”</p>
