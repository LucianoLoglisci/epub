			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.0–0 Bd6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 f6 8.Be3 Ne7 9.Nbd2 Be6 10.Rfd1 Ng6 11.Nc4 Bxc4 12.Qxc4 Qe7</span> - Diagram 291</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’ll borrow Nigel Short’s excellent explanation of this position from his notes in <span class="italic">New In Chess</span> (issue 1, 2007): “A standard position. Black has been compelled to hand back one of his Bishops and he remains with doubled c-pawns—a losing disadvantage, as we know, if ever we reach a King and pawn endgame. That said, he is not without his prospects: the white e-pawn is particularly vulnerable and can only be protected at some inconvenience. While the statics may favor White, the dynamics are certainly in black’s favor and thus an evaluation of approximate equality is in order.”</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: This kind of position mixes ideas that can be easily grasped by players in the 1400 group (i.e., putting pressure on a pawn and making use of one’s active pieces) with the subtle—more advanced—nuances we see in the actual game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Before moving on, let’s address Mr. Short’s comment about the doubled c-pawns being a losing disadvantage in a King and pawn endgame. One of white’s dreams is to exchange all the minor and heavy pieces, which could easily lead to a position like this:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to Move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If it was Black to move, he would actually win by making use of a well-known trick: <span class="bold">1...a3! 2.bxa3 b3!</span> and the pawn will turn into a Queen. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, an experienced player would be alert to this possibility and would play <span class="bold">1.a3! </span>when black’s crippled pawn majority is stopped cold. In effect, this means that Black is a solid pawn down in the King and pawn endgame. To win, all White has to do is to create a passed pawn on the kingside, find a way for his King to penetrate into enemy territory, and that will be that.  <span class="bold">1…g6 </span>Obviously, moves such as 1...bxa3 2.bxa3 or 1...b3 would leave black’s queenside pawns completely immobile.<span class="bold"> 2.g4 </span>Also possible is 2.h4 h6 3.g4 Kd6 4.h5, but 2.axb4?? cxb4 3.cxb4 c3 loses for White. <span class="bold">2…Kd7 </span>Other moves also lose: 2…g5 3.e5! gxf4 4.exf6 Kxf6 5.Kxf4 h6 6.h4 Kg6 7.Ke4 and White picks off all black’s queenside pawns; 2…f5 3.exf5+ gxf5 4.gxf5+ Kxf5 5.h3 Now white’s King will reach e4 since any pawns moves can be met by Kf3-e3-f3 until black’s King is forced to move—5…h6 6.Ke3 h5 7.Kf3 b3 8.Ke3 Kf6 9.Ke4 Ke6 10.f5+ Kf6 11.Kf4 and it’s over. <span class="bold">3.h4 Kd6 </span>3…h6 4.f5 g5 5.hxg5 hxg5 (threatening to draw with ...Kd6) 6.e5! fxe5 7.Ke4 Kd6 8.f6 Ke6 9.f7 Kxf7 10.Kxe5, 1-0. <span class="bold">4.f5 gxf5 5.gxf5</span> 5.exf5 Ke5 6.Ke3 also wins. <span class="bold">5…Ke7 6.h5 h6 7.Ke3 Kd6 8.Kf4 b3 </span>Now that Black no longer has tempo moves with his pawns, White can make use of an important idea that assures the decisive penetration of his King into the enemy position.<span class="bold"> 9.e5+! fxe5+ 10.Ke4 Ke7 11.Kxe5</span>, 1-0.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now back to the position in diagram 291 and the Ganguly - Short game:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13.Re1 0–0–0 14.Rad1 Rhe8 15.Bc1 c5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Dominating the white Knight, which no longer has access to d4, e5, g5, or h4. This means that the highly desirable Knight maneuver, Nf3-d4-f5, is (at least for the moment) off the table.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.b3 Qe6 17.Qxe6+ Rxe6 18.Rd2 b5 19.Kf1 Rde8 20.Rde2 Kb7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">20…Ne5!? is also worthy of consideration.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.g3 h5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has a comfortable game, but he will soon feel compelled to do something Short called “ugly and anti-positional” in order to generate winning chances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">22.Nd2 Ne5 23.f4 Nc6 24.c3 b4!? </span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Intensifying the Statics vs. Dynamics battle</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Here it is! Nigel didn’t want to wait around while White improved his position, but this move further devalues black’s queenside pawns and also hands the white Knight the c4-square on a silver platter. However, though it increases white’s static advantages, it also gives black’s Knight access to d4, thus adding to his dynamics.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.c4?!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Better was 25.Bb2 bxc3 26.Bxc3 though after 26…Nd4 27.Rf2 g5 it’s clear that black’s pieces exert a lot of pressure on white’s position.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Nd4 26.Rf2 g5 27.Bb2 h4 28.Bxd4 cxd4 29.Ke2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White felt that his Knight would dominate black’s Bishop, and this might well have been the case if all the Rooks were exchanged. However, the presence of the heavy pieces leaves the white King feeling insecure, and gives Black an annoying initiative.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…hxg3 30.hxg3 Rh8 31.Rg1??</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White folds. If we follow this book’s basic tenet, which calls for a player to insist on the creation of favorable imbalances for himself, then 31.e5 gxf4 32.gxf4 fxe5 33.f5 (followed by Ne4) makes good sense. For the sacrificed pawn White has a passed pawn of his own and a vastly superior minor piece—in other words, it’s still a battle with each player trying to show why their set of imbalances is better than the opponent’s.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31…d3+ 32.Kxd3 Bc5 33.Rff1 Rd6+</span>, 0-1.</p>
