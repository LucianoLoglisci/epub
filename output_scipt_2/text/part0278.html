			<p class="caption4">Yet another “I’ve never been here before!” kind of position. How would you assess this position? And what specific things in black’s position catch your attention?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 Be6 4.Ne2 f6? 5.Nd2 c5 6.Nf4 Bf7</span> - Diagram 412</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Two things should stand out with multi-colored clarity: White enjoys a sizable lead in development and the e6-square is severely weakened. These things add up to no less than a winning advantage for White! Since you would like to continue developing your army, and since you want to make the e6-square your own, and (finally!) since you wouldn’t mind getting your pawn back, the right move shouldn’t be hard to find.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: It’s not hard to see that one side is ahead in development, and the weakness of e6 should strike your brain as if it were a gong (though this is most likely the one thing that a player under 1400 might miss). Mixing that with the desire to regain your pawn and prepare for castling means that white’s best move is something any player would do from 1000 on.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7.Bxc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Moves don’t get more natural than this. Oddly, White played something else in the actual game: 7.d5? Bxd5 8.Nxd5 Qxd5 9.e4 Qd7 10.Bxc4 Nc6 11.Qh5+ g6 12.Qxc5 Nd4 13.0-0 e6 14.Qa5 b5 15.Bb3 Ne7 16.Bd1 Nec6 17.Qc3 Bg7 18.Nb3 0–0 19.Qh3 f5 20.exf5 exf5 21.Be3 Kh8, 1/2-1/2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Bxc4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">7…Nh6 wasn’t much better, since both 8.Ne6 and 8.Bxf7+ leave Black in a bad way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Nxc4 </span>and black’s position—faced with ideas like Ne6 and/or d5, or Qh5+ in many positions, or even the quiet 0-0 which allows Black to quietly face his own mortality—is lost.</p>
