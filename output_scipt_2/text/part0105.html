			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Our basic thesis is this: If your King is safely castled while the opponent’s is in the middle of the board, I want you to train your mind to view that central King as a target, and immediately try and ascertain whether there’s a way to smite it. At the very least, active play in the center while the enemy’s monarch resides there will allow you to make some important gains as he scrambles to get his King to safety.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Other things being equal, the side with the vulnerable King will always come in second in a head to head clash. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>By now the reader should know the drill: </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Seeing that the enemy King has stayed in the center for too long, immediately get excited and target it for destruction; </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Don’t allow him to castle to safety; </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Bring as many pieces to the embattled area as possible and prepare some form of decisive penetration; </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>Rip open some lines and go for the throat!</p>
