			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There are a lot of facets to passed pawns—knowing when they are good or bad, knowing how to devalue them or how to turn one into a world beater, knowing which pieces highlight a passed pawn or freeze it into place, knowing if the passer is safe or vulnerable, etc. These problems will give you a heads up as to just how much you’ve learned about them.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa1">If you have trouble solving the tests, don’t worry—that means we’ve uncovered something you don’t understand, and this allows you to fix things by rereading the previous material or by picking up the bits of knowledge you’re missing in the answers that will appear under each test (via the TAP FOR ANSWER button).</p>
