			<p class="caption4">There’s a lot going on here. Instead of drowning you in the complications, let’s have you search for a single shred of clarity: what is the most important square on the board in this position?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 e6 5.Bg5 h6 6.Bh4 dxc4 7.e4 g5 8.Bg3 b5 9.Be2 Bb7 10.0–0 Nbd7 11.Ne5 Bg7 12.f4 Nxe5 13.dxe5 Qxd1 14.Raxd1 Nd7 15.f5 0–0–0 16.Bh5 Nc5 17.Bxf7 Bf8 18.Rd6 b4 19.Rxd8+ Kxd8 20.Rd1+ Kc7 21.Ne2 Rh7 22.fxe6 Bc8</span> - Diagram 431</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One could argue about the vast importance of a number of squares—the e-pawn dreams of promoting on e8, black’s Knight longs to leap into d3, etc. However, I’m hoping the pawn structure (as odd as it seems to be) brought to mind a lesson we learned in Part Eight, Passed Pawns—when you have a passed pawn, the most important square is the one directly in front of it. In this case the passed pawn is on e6, which means the answer to our problem is e7!</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you understood that white’s e6-pawn was passed, then you should have also understood that laying claim to the square in front of it is often critical in such situations.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The tripled pawns are almost a distraction from what’s really going on: White has a passed e6-pawn and would love to push it. His light-squared Bishop is containing black’s Rook, and it also controls the promotion square on e8. Thus it’s up to White to make his passer count. To accomplish this, he needs to take control of the e7-square so the pawn can advance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Nd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This not only protects e6, but it also prepares to fight for the e7-square with a well-timed Nf5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Rh8? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black cracks and goes down without much of a fight. He had to try 23…Nd3 (this not only brings the Knight into the thick of things, but also frees c5 for the f8-Bishop), when 24.b3!? Nb2 25.Rf1 c3 leads to some very interesting positions. One possible line: 26.Bg6 Bc5 27.Bxh7 Bxd4+ 28.Bf2 Bxf2+ 29.Kxf2 Ba6 30.Ra1 Nd3+ 31.Ke2 c2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.e7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The prized e6-pawn sacrifices itself, knowing that it will immediately be reincarnated via e5-e6. The point of the sacrifice is that it allows white’s dark-squared Bishop to enter the battle, it leads to the black King being forced away from the embattled area, and it also forces black’s dark-squared Bishop to the vulnerable e7-square.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">24…Bxe7 25.e6+ Kb7 26.Nf5 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White “wins” the e7-square, and with it comes decisive material gain.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">26…Bf6 27.e5 Bd8 28.e7 Bb6 29.Nd6+ Ka8 30.Nxc4</span>, 1-0.</p>
