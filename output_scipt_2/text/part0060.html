			<h3 id="_idParaDest-57" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-26"/>Stepping Beyond Fear</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Over the years, I’ve given innumerable lessons and lectures where the sacrifice of material has been addressed. Players of all ratings are, in general, quite comfortable parting with their stuff if a King-hunt and the promise of mate is in the air. However, if material should be sacrificed for positional reasons I’ve noticed a state of mental “rigor mortis” strike even the hardiest players—they just can’t bring themselves to part with a pawn or the Exchange (things you can see, understand, and even feel) if the return is mere positional “compensation” (A term that reminds us of snake-oil; it promises the world, but always remains invisible to the amateur’s eye).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I never realized the full extent of this problem until I taught one particular student who loved to launch unsound mating attacks. He’d toss a Bishop in the garbage if it allowed him to give the enemy King a few (more often than not, harmless) checks. I didn’t want to fully discourage his aggressive inclinations, but I did want to show him that there are other ways to win a game and that attacks are usually a natural manifestation of various positive imbalances. After quite a few lessons, we finally got around to discussing positional Exchange sacrifices and he fell in love with the idea. Every time I would show him an example, he would say, “Man, I wish I could do that!” I would assure him that the opportunity would arise and, sure enough, his big chance eventually appeared.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In diagram 139 (see next page) it’s clear that Black has played very passively, but everything seems to be defended. White, seeing that Black intended to double on the e-file, played <span class="bold">1.Rfe1 </span>and after <span class="bold">1…Rfe8 </span>he followed with 2.Rxe7 and subsequently allowed the exchange of all the Rooks. The resulting position looked (and is) great, but it proved difficult to penetrate and a draw was the eventual result. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I pointed out to White that he could have targeted the two weak pawns on d6 and f6 (before or after the Rook exchanges) via Ne4 with Be1-c3 and Qd2-b2 to follow (mixed with a well-timed h3-h4). This would have left Black in a good deal of pain. However, far more interesting to me was something that most chess masters would do without thinking:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Rfe1 Rfe8 2.Re6!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We had looked at similar “plug” sacrifices in other lessons, so when he noticed this possibility he said, “I saw it, but just couldn’t bring myself to give the Rook away. I don’t even get a pawn for it, and there’s no kingside attack at all! I wanted to do it because of what you showed me in past lessons, but my hand refused to make the move!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Clearly, the ingrained programming that prevents us from giving away material is extremely strong. As a result, the point of this chapter isn’t just to give examples of material sacrifice, but also to help the student break down those walls that prevent him from following his “imbalance training.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Let’s start by asking a simple question: “Why is 2.Re6 such a good move?” It’s clear that the Rook is a monster on this square, and if it’s allowed to remain it not only kills off both black Rooks but it also adds to the pressure against both f6 and d6. But all this won’t mean much to the amateur, who will rightly demand to know why the Rook can’t be taken. Of course, it <span class="italic">can</span> be taken, but after 2…Bxe6 3.dxe6 we are left with the following one-sided breakdown of the imbalances:</p>

			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Up a solid Exchange.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">White:</span></p>

			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The pawn on f6 is also vulnerable and can be tortured by Nd5 followed by swinging the Queen and dark-squared Bishop over to the a1-h8 diagonal.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The d5-square is a gaping hole, which can be a home to his Knight or Bishop.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>The protected passed pawn on e6 is a monster!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>White’s minor pieces are extremely active while black’s two minor pieces are comically placed.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Black’s Rooks don’t have any open files and are both dead. In fact, white’s minor pieces are far stronger than the enemy Rooks!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What’s clear is that White has every advantage in the position, while black’s only claim to fame is his material advantage. They need to be weighed against each other, and in this case it’s not even close since, on top of everything else (I’ll repeat myself here since it’s a very important point), the black Rooks (due to their lack of open files) are actually weaker than any one of white’s minor pieces!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Nevertheless, the mere fact that Black has a material advantage is more than enough to convince most players to reject the line starting with 2.Re6. It’s a pure case of logic vs. unfounded fear. How can a player get beyond this fear? He has to train himself to view each imbalance as something wonderful, and he has to view material as just another imbalance to be collected or rejected, depending on the nature of the individual position.</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">In all cases of logic vs. fear, you must learn to embrace logic by reading the board and doing what it tells you to do.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"> If a player is going to master my concept of “reading the needs of a position by recognizing and trying to make use of all the imbalances” then he must place material gain or sacrifice on that same list. Yes, some imbalances do have a bit more importance than others. However, although material or an insecure King both demand extra attention, you can’t place them on a pedestal and lose sight of the big picture.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If I told most non-masters that they could have this position as White, they wouldn’t be too pleased. After all, Black seems safe enough, and he’s a pawn up and also has the move. Nevertheless, White has his perks too and these must be dispassionately weighed against black’s small material plus. Take a moment and see if you can list the imbalances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Ready? Okay, here’s how I see it:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">Black</span>—One extra pawn. That’s it! That’s all he has to crow about. Nevertheless, it does carry some weight and forces White to prove sufficient compensation since, if Black can hold things together and manage to make some soothing trades, then he might go on to win an endgame with that “little” extra passed pawn.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">White</span>—The d3-Bishop is “good” (and active!), while black’s Bishop is not only undefended but also playing the role of a defensive pawn. Black’s pawns on d5 and f5 are both vulnerable and will need to be carefully defended. White’s Knight is a tower of strength while the black steed is a passive defender. White’s Queen is far more active than black’s. White’s control of the open e-file takes aim at the slightly vulnerable e6-Bishop and also the hole on e5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">When you add up these things, it’s clear that White has a lot going for him and full compensation for the pawn. In a nutshell, his army is more active than black’s, Black has several weak squares in his camp, and White has clear targets (on d5 and f5) to attack while white’s position is free from weaknesses. Of course, Black is far from doomed but, using the words of Ivanchuk, “For the central pawn White has a good game and well-placed pieces.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game continued quietly, with White calmly building up his forces and adding pressure to the enemy targets:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Qd6 23.Rac1 Rfe8 24.Rc2 Bd7 25.Rce2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note that black’s a8-Rook is tied down to the defense of a7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…a6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">25…Qb6?? fails to 26.Qxb6 axb6 27.Nxd7 Rxe2 28.Nxf6+.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.Nc4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Knight heads for e3 where it will take aim at both d5 and f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26…Qc6 27.Ne3 Rac8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">27…g6 loses to 28.Nxd5! Nxd5 29.Bc4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">28.Nxf5 Bxf5 29.Bxf5 Rxe2 30.Rxe2 Re8 31.Rc2 Qd6 32.g3 g6 33.Bc8 </span>and White, who now has material equality on top of the superior minor piece (the Bishop dominates the Knight), the target on d5, and more activity, eventually won after a long battle.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The student should carefully look over these first two examples again. Clearly, the first one gave White a dominating position, with Black bound and gagged and completely helpless—players 1400 and higher should feel extremely comfortable (even excited!) giving up material for such a one-sided result.</p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Learn to treat material gains and losses as you would any other imbalance.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Our second example (Ivanchuk vs. Harikrishna) was altogether different. In that case White had good compensation for the sacrificed pawn, but many players wouldn’t feel completely comfortable in white’s shoes. This kind of nuanced sacrifice would be more natural for players 2000 and higher. Nevertheless, whether a player is comfortable with something or not, if you read the board and decide that it’s the right thing to do based on our battle of imbalances, then you should bravely give it a try; at the very least, when you see such things occur in master games you’ll finally understand why it was done and have a greater appreciation for the concept.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, sacrifices do carry some element of risk since if you don’t get enough compensation, or don’t use that compensation properly, you can easily find yourself down material in some miserable endgame, or wiped out even earlier by the enemy’s greater firepower. Naturally, there will be cases where you think a positional sacrifice is called for but misjudge the extent of your compensation and go down in flames. In those instances, you have to dust off your ego, analyze what went wrong, and give it another try if the board begs you to do so.</p>
			<p class="float-title">Philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">Don’t allow yourself to develop a fear of any aspect of the game! Once that fear becomes a habit, your ability to progress in chess will be severely hampered. Positions with various forms of material inequality are the basis of many cases of psychological chess paralysis.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A good example comes from my own career: I was never comfortable with giving up my Queen for other units. Even if the material I got for my Queen put me ahead, I still didn’t like it. This mental block stayed with me right up to the high 2100 level, and it was only after I lost a game due to my inability to swap off my Queen for the opponent’s Rook, Bishop, and Knight (obviously this is more than enough for the Queen, but unreasoning fear is often a stronger force than logic and facts) that I decided to put an end to the nonsense once and for all. From that point on I never hesitated to enter such situations. At first I wasn’t comfortable with this “other stuff for my Queen” idea, but if I felt that I would stand well with a solid position and a Rook, Bishop and pawn for my Queen, I would push fear away and do it! How about three minor pieces for my Queen? No problem! And, slowly but surely, such things became a natural part of my game and fear stopped playing any role in that kind of decision. My philosophy was clear: If you lose you lose, but at least you have the courage to stand up for what you think is right for the position. There’s nothing worse than getting pushed off the board and realizing that a lack of self-confidence didn’t allow you to even put up a fight!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">A sharp Sicilian (<span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Be2 Be7 7.0–0 0–0 8.f4 Nc6 9.Be3 e5 10.Nxc6 bxc6 11.Kh1 exf4 12.Bxf4 Be6 13.Bf3 Qb8 14.b3 Qb4 15.Qd2 Rfd8 16.Rad1 Rac8 17.Qe3 d5 18.Be5 Qa5 19.exd5 Nxd5 20.Nxd5 cxd5 21.Bh5 d4 22.Qe4 g6 23.Bf3 Bf5 24.Qf4 Bg5 25.Qxg5 Qxe5</span>) led to the following complex position:</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 142</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s c2-pawn is about to fall and he pretty much has to decide on 26.c4, which leaves Black with a scary looking passed d-pawn and approximately equal chances, or the more macho 26.Bg4, which is the prelude to an Exchange sacrifice. Svidler decided to go for the gusto: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.Bg4 h6 27.Rxf5 Qg7 28.Qe7?!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This eventually allows Black to gain a bit of time kicking the Queen around. 28.Qh4 was better, with equal chances. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">28…gxf5 29.Bxf5 </span></p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Optically this looks pretty good. White gets a pawn for the Exchange, c2 is well defended, the enemy pawns on a7 and d4 need looking after, and the position of the black King has become a bit drafty.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s clear that White has real compensation, but there’s a problem: White needs to play with energy and try to develop some initiative. If Black can prevent this, and if he can consolidate his position and activate his Rooks, they might end up overpowering the White army. Indeed, after some errors this is exactly what happened: </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Re8 30.Qd6 Rcd8 31.Qa6 Qg5 32.Bd3 Re7 33.Rf1 Kg7 34.g3 Qd5+ 35.Kg1 Rd6 36.Qc8 Qe6 37.Qb8 Rb6 38.Qd8 Rd6 39.Qb8 Rd5 40.Rf4 Rg5 41.Rf3 Qe5 42.Qd8 h5 43.Rf2 Re6 44.Qd7 Rf6 45.Re2 Qf4 46.Re4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">46.Re8 gave better chances to hold on. After 46.Re4 the game is just over.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">46…Qf2+ 47.Kh1 h4</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So was Svidler’s Exchange sacrifice the wrong thing to do? Will the trauma make him avoid such sacrifices in the future? Not at all! His decision made good sense, but he was outplayed and the game slipped out of his hands. It happens to everyone. I guarantee that he’ll be making many more Exchange sacrifices as his career continues.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Only by trying something and getting hands-on experience can you truly understand it. And, even if you courageously go for a “grand scheme” and it all goes to hell, you’ll still feel proud of yourself for giving free reign to your creative doppelganger.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Some people consider this game to be the greatest of all time (though our focus will be on the initial greed, not the later brilliance). In this position Fischer is putting some pressure against the space-gaining e5-pawn (though it’s easily defended). Oddly, the most accessible target  (remember that something is only weak if you can bring pieces to bear on it) is the pawn on a4 (…Na6-c5 combined with …Qe8 and, if need be, …Bd7), but capturing it (which entails a loss of time) will give White definite compensation in the form of central space and development (as Black tosses everything at a4, White will be getting the rest of his army out).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In this example, we aren’t looking at the safe consumption of a weak pawn. Instead, we’re going to see a player create divergent imbalances (the trade of time/development for material) in an effort to sharpen the play and give himself a shot at victory. Naturally, this approach can lead to joy or despair, depending on whether the bout of greed is positionally and/or tactically justified, and on which player can handle the tension better.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So, sometimes going after material entails a certain level of risk—in much the same way that giving it up might be risky. But more often than not, taking material is business as usual—<span class="italic">acquiring stuff</span> is merely the other side of the material coin. In fact, most games are won by eating the opponent’s pieces, made possible by his blunders, or via the slow and steady accumulation of positive imbalances that ultimately result in material gain (creating weaknesses, freezing those weaknesses, surrounding them, and finally cashing in).</p>

One devil (the devil of “unbridled sacrifice”) tells Black to go for the gusto and sacrifice his Queen. The other devil (the devil of “take it while you can”) implores Black to eat a pawn on b2.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">In this sharp position Black can embrace his inner greed by 6…Qxb2 7.Rb1 (7.Nc7+ Kd8 8.Bf4 d3! is very strong. One funny line: 9.Rc1 Bd4 10.Qd2 g5 11.Bg3 Bxf2+!!) 7…Qxa2 8.Ra1 Qb2 9.Rb1 Qa3 10.Nc7+ Kd8 11.Nb5 Qc5 12.Nxd4 Bxd4 (12…Qa5+!?) 13.Bxd4 Qa5+ 14.Ke2 Nf6 and though White has some compensation, he is <span class="italic">two</span> pawns down.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There is nothing wrong with embracing your inner greed. In fact, taking material and daring your opponent to prove his compensation puts a lot of pressure on him since, to put it in a stark manner, if the sacrifice doesn’t work the game is over. The two most famous greed-kings are grandmasters Larry Evans and Victor Korchnoi. These extremely successful players would take whatever was offered and then hang on for dear life!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">However, in the position in diagram 147 Black noticed a far more creative (but not necessarily superior) possibility: <span class="bold">6…dxe3!!? 7.Nxb6 exf2+ 8.Kxf2 axb6</span></p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Has Black gone berserk?</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">That’s right. White has a Queen and the move for two minor pieces and a pawn. Yet, White’s position is far from easy to handle. Let’s have Mr. Mayo himself explain his logic behind the startling 6…dxe3:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“For the queen, Black has an ultra safe King, two minor pieces, an extra pawn, plus almost total dark square control. Also, consider the lovely squares Black gets for his minors—e5, e6, c5, c6 or even d4 beckon piece placement.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">“White has a displaced King, development deficit and a horrible light-squared Bishop with no active prospects. He is faced with the immediate loss of two more pawns with …Bxb2 and so his Queen is confined to defensive duties. One other critical factor to be considered is that White does not have a single effective pawn lever at his disposal. He does not even have the prospect of an active Exchange sacrifice to alter the position (only perhaps passive sacs with Rd5 at some future point).”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In short, black’s pieces will be more active than white’s, White has no way to break into the enemy position, and Black has various targets (squares and pawns) that he can chew on while the white position is devoid of any plan. It’s clear that Mr. Mayo has a very good grasp of the imbalances and how to measure their pros and cons without falling victim to purely material (point count) considerations.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Okay, I can imagine many of you saying, “Nice, but I could never do anything like that.” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Why not? Yes, you have to somehow free yourself of the “I can’t” mindset, which is also explored in Part Four. But once you notice 6…dxe3, and once you see that you’ll be giving up your Queen for two minors and a pawn, don’t panic and say, “No way!” Instead calmly look at the imbalances in the resulting position and, if you appreciate what you are getting for the material investment (many positive imbalances for material), why not pull the trigger and do it? In fact, if you really want to improve, you should always jump on such situations (win or lose) so you can expand your chess mind and plant the seeds for future successes.</p>
			<p class="float-title">remember</p>
			<p class="float-text">If you create “imbalance vision” and make the search for (and understanding of) imbalances an addiction, your playing strength will take a quantum leap forward.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game, Mr. Mayo’s concept came through with flying colors:<span class="bold"> 9.Qd2 Nc6 10.Nf3 Nf6 11.Bd3 Ng4+ 12.Ke2 0–0 13.h3 Nge5 14.Nxe5 Nd4+ 15.Kf2 Bxe5 16.Rhf1 d6 17.Kg1 Be6 18.Qb4 Nc6 19.Qb5 Ra5 20.Qb3 Rfa8 21.a3 b5 22.Qc2 bxc4 23.Be2 Bd4+ 24.Kh1 Ne5 25.Rad1 Bc5 26.Rfe1 b5 27.Qc3 Ra4 28.Rf1 b4 29.axb4 Rxb4 30.Ra1 Rab8 31.Ra2 Rb3 32.Qd2 Re3 33.Qc2 c3 34.bxc3 Bxa2 35.Qxa2 Rxc3 36.Bg4 Re3 37.Be6 Rf8 38.Bd5 Kg7 39.Qa6 e6 40.Bxe6 fxe6 41.Rxf8 Kxf8 42.Qc8+ Ke7 43.Qb7+ Nd7 44.Qa8 Re1+ 45.Kh2 Bg1+ 46.Kh1 Bd4+ 47.Kh2 Be5+ 48.g3 Re3</span>,  0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This was very advanced stuff, but it wasn’t about calculation at all. Ultimately it came down to having faith in the power of “lesser” imbalances over material. And this is a concept that you can (slowly but surely) train into your psyche at almost any rating level.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Our next example shows a pawn sacrifice that directly addresses the imbalances and goals that both sides were trying to achieve. <a id="W.-Browne---J.-Silman--American-Open-1998"/>W.

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position is an easy read: Black’s King is vulnerable and needs to be cared for while white’s pawn structure is a mess. Quite simply, Black will have the advantage if he can find a safe haven for his King!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Note how I didn’t mention the threat of gxh6+. The reason is that one should have a firm grasp of the imbalances (and the goals that their existence creates) before thinking about threats and replies to them. Now that we know what both sides are trying to achieve (White wants to attack the enemy King, Black wants to find a safe home for it and then punish white’s weak central pawns), the correct move for Black will make perfect sense.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Bg6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Played instantly (Browne hoped for 23…hxg5 24.Qh5 when White’s pieces are getting uncomfortably close to black’s King). However, all of a sudden (after 23…Bg6) black’s weak points (f7 is cemented and h5 is no longer a landing space for white’s Queen) are solidly defended, and white’s position begins to creak and whine.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Why is 23…Bg6 a hard move to find? We’ve been conditioned to avoid losing material. In this case you are giving up a pawn with check, so the mind automatically screams, “Don’t let him take it!” and blinds you to all other possibilities. That’s why creating an imbalance-oriented base of knowledge about every position you reach is so important—knowing a position’s priorities allows you to step beyond the emotive mind and make decisions where logic, not emotion, rules.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24.gxh6+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">24.b4 is answered by 24…Qxe5. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">24…Kh7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White’s a pawn ahead but the bits on e5, e4, and h6 are like overripe fruit that Black can pick whenever he wants to. Equally important is the black King’s new situation—it’s found some welcome cover on h7 and the white pawn on h6 actually plays the role of traitor since it’s suddenly giving shelter to the opposing King.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I felt very confident here, but both of us now had only 3 minutes to make 16 moves! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Bf4 Be7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The critical move (and my original intention) was 25…Rd4! 26.Be3 Rad8! 27.Bxd4 Rxd4 28.Rad1 Rxd1 29.Rxd1 Qxe5 when Black has all the play. But h2-h4-h5 ghosts began to nag at me and, having no time for a deep look, irrationality won out and I decided to stop the h-pawn in its tracks. I passed on 25…Nd7 due to 26.h4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">26.Rf2 Rd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Going after the e5-pawn by 26…Nd7!? was also tempting, but the clock was ticking and a decision had to be made! </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I had been dying to sacrifice the Exchange all through this game, and now I jumped at the chance. However, this was not the best moment to do so, and the safer 28…Rd7 would have left Black firmly in charge since 29.Bf4 is strongly met by 29…Bf6! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">29.Bxd4 Qxd4+ 30.Kh1</span>, 1/2-1/2. I had thought that I stood better here, but a quick look convinced me that things are actually far from clear: 30…Nxe4 (30…Kxh6 with an edge is best, but it didn’t occur to me during the game) 31.Bd3 Nxc3 32.Bxg6+ Rxg6 33.bxc3 Qxc3 34.Rf1 Bf6 35.Rxg6 Kxg6. With no time left, neither side wanted to touch this position!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I should point out that offering various material imbalances is a part of many highly respected openings (we’ll stress positional sacrifices here, and not attack-based sacs). A few examples:</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Why is this acceptable for Black? Aside from the fact that he has a pawn for the Exchange (making the material investment minimal), white’s King is also a bit insecure, black’s Bishop is not only very active but also serves as a magnificent defender of its own King, and Black enjoys the superior pawn structure. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Another problem for White concerns our eternal search for a plan. White has no play on the queenside or in the center, and aggressive posturing on the kingside will rarely work because the Bishop singlehandedly protects its King (an example of this will be given in the notes that follow). Black, however, can generate queenside play by the advance of his a- and b-pawns (a minority attack) and also place pressure on e4 (…Rc8-c4). All in all, it’s thought to be equal but I consider it to be somewhat dreary for White.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The game <a id="A.-Filipowicz---A.-Hollis--Marianske-Lazni-1962"/>A. Filipowicz - A. Hollis, Marianske Lazni 1962 continued: <span class="bold">18.c3 Rc8 19.a3 Rc4 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">20.Rae1 b5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Starting a classic minority attack. Black intends to move his Queen, play …a7-a5 and then …b5-b4 cracking white’s queenside pawn structure and leaving him with yet another weakness to guard in that area.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Rf3 Qc7 22.fxg6 hxg6 23.Rh3 a5 24.Rf1 Qb7!</span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Re1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">25.Qh6 looks scary, but Dragon players (and anyone that regularly fianchettos his kingside Bishop) know that it’s very hard to mate a King when the defender’s uncontested (White doesn’t have a dark-squared Bishop to challenge it) dark-squared Bishop defends g7 and h8. After 25…Rxe4! Black laughs at white’s so-called attack since 26.Qh7+ Kf8 isn’t anything for White, and 26.Rxf6 Rg4+ leaves White having to choose between 27.Rg3 Rxg3+ 28.hxg3 exf6 (two pawns up for Black), and 27.Kf1 Qh1+ with a winning attack for Black!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The immediate 25.Rxf6 might seem to be a better move order, but this also fails: 25…Rxe4! 26.Rxg6+ (26.Qh6 Rg4+) 26…fxg6 27.Qg5 (27.Qh6 Rg4+) 27…Re6 and White’s in serious trouble (28.Qh6? Qb6+ wins on the spot).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">25…b4 26.axb4 axb4</span> and White is under severe pressure. His queenside is falling apart and, as we’ve seen, the attacking leap 27.Qh6 just doesn’t get the job done.</p>
			<h5 id="_idParaDest-61" class="sub-chapter-l"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-22"/>Catalan Opening</h5>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One would think that many players with White (see diagram 153) would be delighted to achieve such a position by move 13 of the opening (the initial moves are <span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 d5 4.Bg2 dxc4 5.Nf3 c5 6.0–0 Nc6 7.Qa4 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qxd4 9.Bxc6+ Bd7 10.Rd1 Qxd1+ 11.Qxd1 Bxc6 12.Qc2 Be7 13.Qxc4 0–0</span>). White has a Queen for black’s Rook and Bishop, and all of white’s pawns are healthy and his King is safe. So, why would anyone in his right mind actually play for this position as Black?</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Shockingly, world-class grandmaster Ulf Andersson often reached this position, which he considered to be a drawing line. And he proved it over and over by halving the point with many of the world’s finest players (Kasparov included!). Why is Black okay here? Quite simply, his position is devoid of weaknesses, he’s extremely solid, his c6-Bishop gives him ownership of the light squares, and White found it more or less impossible to tear down black’s fortress. In other words, white’s only favorable imbalance is his material advantage, and that alone isn’t enough to generate any real winning chances.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">One sample (the game <a id="L.-Polugaevsky---U.-Andersson--Moscow-1981"/>L. Polugaevsky - U.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Material sacrifices that create a “battle of the imbalances” are commonplace in virtually every opening. An excellent example of this is the highly popular Marshall Attack, which sees Black offering a pawn for a lead in development, active pieces, a slight weakening of the light squares in white’s kingside, and good dynamic chances. On the other hand, White has a solid position and an extra pawn.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">In diagram 154, both sides have put their faith in their respective short and long term imbalances.

White’s still a pawn up, but black’s still active! The draw is now forced since 35.Kd1 would be dangerous only for White: 35…Bd3 36.Ra6+ Ke5 37.Rxh6 Rxf2 38.h4 Kf4 39.Nd5+ Kxg4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It’s clear that black’s compensation for the pawn isn’t just a hope and a prayer—it’s based on sound positional considerations that last late into the game. One might wonder why everyone wouldn’t play a line that gives Black a short-term attack and long-term positional compensation. The answer is that White has many ways to avoid falling victim to a fast mate, and though the resulting positions are often drawn, Black has to suffer a bit—perhaps not the kind of result keen attacking fans would dream of, but fully acceptable as far as theory is concerned.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It must also be admitted that many players with the white pieces aren’t too excited by those “pleasant but probably not winning” endgames. These unsatisfied souls constantly seek new ways to stir the pot. One sample: <span class="bold">12.d4 Bd6 13.Re1 Qh4 14.g3 Qh3 15.Re4 g5 16.Qf1</span> (Avoiding 16.Bxg5?? Qf5—it’s not wise to put too many pieces on undefended squares!) <span class="bold">16…Qxf1+ 17.Kxf1 Bf5 18.f3 h6 19.Nd2 Bxe4 20.fxe4</span> when a major change in the mutual imbalances has occurred!</p>

				</div>
			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">White’s now down an Exchange, but he has a pawn for it, a nice center, and two Bishops. Full compensation, but the chances are probably more or less balanced.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">There’s no doubt that material is a major imbalance, with greed winning many games and also losing its share too. If you train yourself to view material as just another (albeit very important) imbalance, you’ll open up a whole new level of understanding where sacrificing for tactical or positional compensation is always on the table. On the other hand, bravely taking everything your opponent offers should also be a part of your overall mindset—in either case, the decision depends on a calm assessment of the imbalances that both sides end up with.</p>
