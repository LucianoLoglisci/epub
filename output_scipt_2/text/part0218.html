			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This line of the Samisch King’s Indian has had moments of popularity among those who like doing something offbeat, and who love playing positions that offer strange material imbalances. It turns out that taking on g3 is the critical continuation.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: If you haven’t seen the answer before, then this will prove extremely difficult even for masters, many of whom will feel (with some justification) that it simply can’t be sound.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Nxg3!? 10.Qf2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Did you stop here after seeing that this move wins material? Did black’s next move (11…Nxf1) occur to you, or did the “autopilot brain” dismiss it instantly since it obviously loses the Queen? This is, of course, very advanced and I don’t expect you to find this kind of sacrificial sequence (so don’t feel bad if you didn’t!). However, once you go over all the examples in this section, once you ponder them and begin to view them as imbalance vs. imbalance, then you’ll find yourself developing an appreciation and understanding of situations that appear to spit in the face of point count. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, 10.Bf2 is met by 10…Nxf1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…Nxf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Initiating a positional sacrifice of the Queen! I’ve known several strong players who were very attracted to this idea but didn’t really believe in its ultimate soundness. Nevertheless, I suspect there’s still a lot to discover in this system and it might well prove to be better than its reputation.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">11.Qxh4 Nxe3 12.Qf2 Nxc4</span>A very interesting position! Black has two Bishops and two pawns for the Queen. That’s not a bad material tradeoff for the second player. He also has a solid position with only one potential weakness (c7), and Black knows that even if c7 falls, the time White takes to get it might allow black’s army to get frighteningly active. Other than attacking c7, White only has one other plan: pushing the h-pawn to h5 in an effort to frighten black’s King.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb1">Though white’s army doesn’t work together very well and doesn’t have many options as far as plans are concerned, Black has pawn breaks like …c7-c6 and …f7-f5, as well as all sorts of annoying Knight leaps. The dark-squared Bishop can occasionally turn into a beast on the h8-a1 diagonal if, after …f7-f5, White captures on f5 and allows a later …e5-e4. But even if this never happens, the Bishop can go to h6 with serious effect.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In general, the position is very difficult for both sides to handle and its study will give you an appreciation as to just how well minor pieces can handle themselves when facing off against a Queen.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Please keep in mind that I’m not trying to convince you to play this variation in your own games. The point is to break the conditioning that’s left you with a fear of losing material, and to make you feel more comfortable when material imbalances are created.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here are two examples of White drowning in the kind of complications that result from this line. Both are filled with serious mistakes, but don’t let that blind you to power of the black army once it’s unleashed. I purposely didn’t add notes. Just sit back and enjoy the carnage:</p>
