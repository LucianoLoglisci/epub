			<p class="caption4">White is threatening to win by Nb6 or Nxe7+, while chopping on f6 is also looming. It’s clear that white’s Knight has to be taken, but with what? Black usually tries to avoid giving up the two Bishops by …Bxd5 in analogous positions, but taking with the Knight might hang the e7-pawn (which is often indirectly protected, and this might or might not be the case here). What is the right way to capture on d5?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 g6 5.c4 Nf6 6.Nc3 d6 7.Be2 Nxd4 8.Qxd4 Bg7 9.Bg5 0–0 10.Qd2 Be6 11.0–0 a6 12.f3 Qa5 </span>(12…Rc8!?)<span class="bold"> 13.Rfd1 Rfc8 14.Nd5 Qxd2 </span>(14…Qd8!? 15.Nxf6+ [15.Bxf6!?] 15…exf6 16.Bf4 f5! deserves serious consideration)<span class="bold"> 15.Rxd2</span> - Diagram 408</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Many strong players would give thumb’s up to 15…Nxd5, which was the move played in the actual game. However, as we’ll soon see, it unexpectedly falls on its face. So, it turns out that 15…Bxd5 is the right move since it avoids black’s fate in the game, though after 16.exd5 white’s space, two Bishops, and potential pressure down the e-file leaves him a with a little something. One might think it’s simply good for White, but Black is solid and has ideas like …a5 or …b5 followed by …b4—both would solidify the c5-square for black’s Knight and challenge the supremacy of White’s bishops. </p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think this is deceptively difficult. Most players under 2000 would avoid 15…Nxd5 since that appears to hang the e7-pawn. On the other hand, many experienced players would want to avoid giving up the two Bishops by 15…Bxd5. In the end, the assessment of this position depends on the tactical and positional ability to see beyond the obvious, and see beyond the usual motifs.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Nxd5? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As stated above, Black should have tried 15…Bxd5 16.exd5 when White has a slight advantage. If I was playing this line for Black, I would try one of the earlier suggestions (12…Rc8!? or 14…Qd8!?).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.exd5 Bd7 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">This is usually fine for Black because the capture on e7 fails to …Bh6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Bxe7! Bh6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Winning material since 18.Rc2 Bf5 doesn’t help White, and 18.Rdd1 Re8 wins a piece. Did White just fall for a trap?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Rad1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It turns out that Black was the one that fell for a trap!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…Bxd2 19.Rxd2 Re8 20.Bxd6 </span>and White, with two active Bishops and two pawns for the Exchange (which creates a monster pawn majority) has a winning advantage: <span class="bold">20…f6 21.Kf2 Kf7 22.b3 h5 23.a4 Rad8 24.c5 g5 25.Bc4 Rc8 26.Bc7 Rh8 27.Re2 Rce8 28.d6+ Kg6 29.Rd2 Re5 30.Bd5 a5 31.Bxa5 Rhe8</span>, 1-0. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Even though you might know a position’s basics, you can’t go on autopilot and, with “eyes closed,” use your usual plans and setups without making sure they work in the exact position in front of you. Even the slightest change can turn all your assessments on their head, so try your best to look at every position with fresh eyes, no matter how much knowledge you possess!</p>
