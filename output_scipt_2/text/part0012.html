			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are minor pieces (along with Bishops), and are generally given a point-count value of 3 (the same as Bishops).</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights crave advanced support points (i.e., a safe square that can’t easily be challenged by a hostile pawn). Since they are short-range pieces, having access to such a square is a huge part of proper Knight strategy.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights gain in strength as they move further up the board. As a rule of thumb:</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight stuck on the 1st or 2nd ranks is a defensive piece and is inferior to a healthy Bishop (a diseased Bishop is quite another matter).</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on the 3rd rank is a flexible workhorse and can be used for defense or attack at a moment’s notice. A Knight on the 3rd often has serious central influence. </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 4th rank support point is a very strong, flexible piece. You can count on it to ably perform both defensive and offensive duties. </p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 5th rank support point can be a beautiful thing to behold. It’s a potent offensive weapon and is usually superior to a Bishop.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on a 6th rank support point can make children weep and women cry for joy. Here a Knight transforms from horse to Octopus, its many appendages spiking out in all directions and claiming enemy territory as its own. Such a Knight is, at times, stronger than a Rook.</p>
			<p class="list-1-l"><span class="_idgenbnmarker1">•</span>A Knight on the 7th and 8th ranks gives us a case of diminishing returns. Once past the 6th, it no longer controls as many squares since its reach runs out of board. Usually a Knight on such an advanced rank is performing some sort of tactical or search and destroy operation.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are the best blockaders of enemy passed pawns. The reason for this is simple: Unlike other pieces, a Knight that’s sitting in front of an enemy pawn isn’t losing any of its mobility. Advantage Knight!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights are short-range pieces. Unlike Bishops, which can slide the length of the board in a single move, Knights are more “restrained”. Advantage Bishop!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights can jump over other pieces. There isn’t anything else that can do this. Advantage Knight!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights have the potential to attack or defend anything on any colored square—it might take several moves, but eventually they will get there. Bishops are always stuck on one color. Advantage Knight!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Knights do quite well in closed positions because, unlike Bishops, pawns can’t block them. Advantage Knight! </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Because Knights are short-range pieces, you need to calmly march them to the desired post. This might take two or three moves, but it’s something that needs to be done.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>If you hear a square calling out to your Knight (or see a beckoning glow), do everything in your power to get your horse there (It doesn’t matter if you have to move forward, backwards, sideways, or a combination of all these things to reach it.)!</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Just because a minor piece is “nicely” developed to the usual respected squares on the 3rd rank doesn’t mean it’s doing anything from that post. Does it have a future on that square? Is it working with the other pieces towards the fulfillment of some unified plan? If the answer to these questions is “no,” then it’s important that you find a better home for the horse and then do your utmost to get it there.</p>
