			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black, who suffers from a lack of space in the center and on the kingside, can’t do anything but go back and forth. This means that White can take his time and build up his position in any way he sees fit. White’s extra kingside space—plus the fact that his Rooks, Bishops, and Queen are all aimed in that direction—offer him excellent chances of a successful kingside attack. I hope you also noticed black’s g7-Bishop, which has earned full Tall-Pawn status! Dare we assign the h7-Rook honorary Tall-Pawn status too?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The question about how you see this game playing out might seem odd, but a trained eye would conclude that Black might very well play …g6-g5 at some point, leading to a well known pawn structure (we addressed it in Part Three, Rooks) with very clear plans to combat it. Huge kudos if you made that connection between one pawn structure and a very possible future one!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game, Grandmaster Panno, a wonderful positional player, did his best <span class="italic">Cat and Mouse</span> imitation, torturing his opponent for a long, long time until he finally put the poor guy out of his misery.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I have full confidence that the 1400 group will recognize that White isn’t in any hurry at all. On the other hand, seeing the possible shift of pawn structures is very difficult, and so the spread leapt right up to Master! </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28.Rf3 Kh8 29.Qf1 Rg8 30.Rfg3 g5 </span>(Bingo! We arrive at a structure that you should be familiar with!) <span class="bold">31.Rh3 Bf8 32.Qf3 Rgg7 33.Kg1 Kg8 34.Ne2 Rh8 35.Ng3 Rgh7 36.Qd1 Qe8 37.Rhh2 Bg7 38.Ra2 </span>(Toying with the thematic idea of 39.b4 axb4 40.a5, crashing through on the queenside.)<span class="bold"> 38…Nb7 </span>(Black avoids it!)<span class="bold"> 39.Nh5 Qb8 40.Rh3 Be8 41.Ng3 Bf8 42.Rah2 Bd7 43.Kf2 Qe8 44.Qh1 </span>(Panno dazzles his opponent with a very mean looking Alekhine’s Gun, but black’s defenses hold and White has to create a more imaginative piece configuration.)<span class="bold"> 44…Qf7 45.Be2 Bc8 46.Bf3 Bd7 47.Ne2 </span>(White realizes that it will take a sacrifice to break through black’s defenses, and this move is the first step in setting this up. The Knight will move to d3 where it will hit e5. Then the Queen will find its way to h2, his dark-squared Bishop to c3, and finally the Knight will slam onto e5 and crack Black open!)<span class="bold"> 47…Nd6 48.Nc1 Bc8 49.Nd3 Ba6 50.Kg3 Qg7 51.Kf2 Qf7 52.Qe1 Nb7 53.Qc3 Bg7 54.Kg3 Bf8 55.Rh1 Qe8 56.Qd2 Qf7 57.Qh2 </span>(Mixing duties between pressure down the h-file and a strike on e5.)<span class="bold"> 57…Nd6 58.Bd2 </span>(Black is being reminded that queenside-shredding sacrifices are still in the air.)<span class="bold"> 58…Nb7 </span>(Poor Black sees threats coming from every direction. This stops any queenside silliness, just in case! But White has something far more lethal in mind.)<span class="bold"> 59.Bc3 Qg7 60.Kf2 </span>(White has brilliantly surrounded his opponent and maximized all his possible breaks—his pieces are now perfectly balancing their attention on the queenside, center, and kingside!)<span class="bold"> 60…Nd6 61.Nxe5 </span>(One can almost imagine a booming sound and smoke rising lazily into the sky.)<span class="bold"> 61…fxe5 62.Bxe5 Qf7 63.hxg5 Bg7 </span>(63…hxg5 64.Bxh8) <span class="bold">64.g6 Qe8 65.g5</span>, 1-0. A great performance by Panno!</p>
