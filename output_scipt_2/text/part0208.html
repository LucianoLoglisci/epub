			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">With the superior pawn structure and active Bishop vs. Tall-Pawn, White has a small but annoying plus.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A basic assessment is pretty straightforward (thus the 1400 level citation). Deciding that exchanging white’s Knight for black’s poor Bishop is the way to go isn’t straightforward at all (leading us to the 2200 level citation)!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18.Nc7!?</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A surprise, but it fits in nicely with our overview of Bishops. Carlsen realizes that the enemy Bishop, though ugly, is actually a good defensive piece (in other words, it’s inactive but useful). Due to this, he exchanges the Bishop for the Knight, which will force the King to defend f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">18…Rag8 19.Nxe6 Kxe6 20.Rxg8 Nxg8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Knight is heading to e7, where it will defend both d5 and f5. However, 20…Rxg8 21.Rc1 Rg2 22.Ke2 Rh2 was a more active defensive possibility, with good chances to hold the draw.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">21.Ke2 Ne7 22.Kf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The King improves its position and, after some preparation, intends to take up residence on f4 where it will work with the Bishop in pressuring f5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Rc8 23.a4 Rc7 24.a5 h6 25.h4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White is making spatial gains on both wings and is slowly but surely improving the positions of his pieces and pawns. The advance of white’s a-pawn means that …a7-a6 would fix black’s queenside pawns on light-squares (this makes them vulnerable in the Bishop versus Knight endgame that can easily occur). If Black tries …b7-b6 at some point, White can capture and use the a-file for a bothersome Rook penetration. Note that black’s Rook can’t do anything on the c-file because the Bishop covers c4 and c2, while the b2-pawn covers c3. White’s h-pawn will advance to h5 where it keeps the Knight out of g6. That allows white’s King to go to f4 without fearing a Knight check.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once all this is done, White will improve the position of his Rook, mixing threats of taking the c- and g-files with attacking possibilities against the h6-pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I should add that all this is very advanced. Instead of feeling deflated by the complexity of it all, I implore you to watch for two things:</p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="list-1-sa"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Keep your eyes on the Bishop and how it constantly proves itself to be far more flexible than the Knight.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>Watch how White makes sure all his pieces are ideally placed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">You’re looking to absorb patterns here, not to understand reams of analysis or grandmaster level maneuvering!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Kf6 26.h5 Nc8 27.Kf4 Nd6 28.Rg1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">28.a6!? was also interesting.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">28…Rc8 29.f3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Very useful—e4 is taken away from the Knight (Anti-Knight Strategy) and e3-e4 becomes a possibility at the right time. Note that White has no interest in b2-b3 since, aside from being unnecessary (…Nc4 would hang the f5-pawn), it would block the bishop’s access to a4 and give the enemy Rook access to c3.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">After 29.f3, a near-zugzwang position has occurred: If Black moves his Rook off the c-file White would claim it by Rc1, if Black plays 29…b6, then 30.axb6 axb6 31.Ra1 gives White the a-file, if Black moves his King to e7 then moves such as 30.Bxf5 or 30.Rg7 or 30.Ke5 all become possible, if 29…Rc7 then 30.Rg8 is very strong, and finally, if 29…Ke6 (as played in the game), then 30.Rg7 adds to black’s woes. This means that, like it or not, 29…a6! (even though it fixes the queenside pawns on light-squares) needs to be given a shot since White can’t maintain the zugzwang—in that case 30.Rg2 Rc1 gives Black counterplay, 30.b3? Rc3 favors Black, and 30.Bb1 Ke6 holds since 31.Rg7 now allows 31…Rc1 with a key tempo on the Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Ke6? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">As pointed out in the note to white’s 29th move, 29…a6! was correct.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30.Rg7 Rh8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Else White would win the h-pawn via Rh7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">31.Bc2! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The Bishop shows its stuff! Since the f5-pawn is well defended, the Bishop moves to b3 where it will torture d5.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">31…Rc8 32.Bb3 Rh8 33.Rg1 Rc8 34.Rg7 Rh8 35.Rg2 Rc8 36.Rg1 </span></p>

			</div></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">White has been using zugzwang motifs to improve his position with gain of time. Black’s problem is that he can’t give White the c-file, but he also can’t play a move like …Rc7 since that would drop h6 to Rg7-h7. This means Black is left going back and forth, hoping White can’t find a decisive breakthrough.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">36…Ne8 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">On 36…Nc4 both 37.Bxc4 and 37.e4 would pose Black serious problems. The move Black played allows White to break with e3-e4 (whether of not that wins is another matter), however he wasn’t able to stem the tide any longer. For example, 36…a6 would lead to another zugzwang: 37.Rg7 (threatening Rh7) 37…Rh8 38.Rg2 (threatening Rc1) 38…Rc8 39.Rg1 and Black has to either give up the c-file or move his Knight and allow e3-e4.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">37.e4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Avoiding the catastrophic 37.Rg8?? Nf6 38.Rxc8 Nxh5 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">37…fxe4 38.fxe4 Nf6 39.e5 Ne4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Not 39…Nxh5+?? 40.Ke3 when the Knight is trapped on h5.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The game raged on for quite awhile. Both sides made some serious slips, but ultimately Black went down in defeat. I’ll give the rest without commentary, but the battle between the Bishop and Knight continues until one of the pieces finally disappears: <span class="bold">40.Ke3 b6 41.axb6 axb6 42.Kd3 Nf2+ 43.Ke2 Ne4 44.Ke3 f6 45.Rg6 Rc1 46.Rxh6 Rh1 47.Bc2 Rh3+ 48.Kf4 Rh4+ 49.Kf3 Nd2+ 50.Ke2 Rh2+ 51.Kd1 Nc4 52.Rxf6+ Ke7 53.Bg6 Rd2+ 54.Kc1 Rxd4 55.b3 Nxe5 56.Rxb6 Rh4 57.Bf5 Nf3 58.h6 Nd4 59.h7 Nxf5 60.Rb8 Nd4 61.Kb2 Kd6 62.h8=Q Rxh8 63.Rxh8 Kc5 64.Rh5 Nc6 65.Rh4 Nb4 66.Ka3 d4 67.Rh5+ Nd5 68.Kb2 Kc6 69.Ka3 Kc5 70.Rh4 Nb4 71.Rh8 Nc6 72.Rh5+ Kd6 73.b4 d3 74.Rh3 Ne5 75.Kb3 d2 76.Kc2 Nc6 77.Rh4 Kd5 </span>and Black resigned without waiting for the reply.</p>
