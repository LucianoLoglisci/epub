			<h3 id="_idParaDest-73" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-10"/>Pushing Your Own Agenda</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In a way, this is an extension of the “negative” Mental Breakdown chapter. Though we will still be exploring the “I can’t” and “rubbish!” mentality, our main focus will be on pushing one’s own agenda. Thus, mantras such as “I will find a way!” and “I must!” take precedence here.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">While the previous chapter brought the problems of mental domination/supplication to light, and hopefully, made you aware that this is something that affects everyone on some level, this chapter rams home the need for a positive mindset. And, in turn, a positive “I’ll do what I want no matter what you say” psychological/emotional state often leads to degrees of mental domination that you might never have thought possible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Personally, I’ve had hundreds of games where my opponent begins to react to me. He is usually unaware of his sudden, extremely subtle defensive demeanor, but once I sense this—even though the position is completely equal—I become sure that he’s on his way down and that victory will eventually be mine.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Chess writers have traditionally used the word <span class="italic">initiative </span>when a player is taking control of the game’s tempo, but I vastly prefer the psychologically charged mantras I’m using here. One side makes a move that pushes his agenda, the other side reacts, and a note appears that says, “White has now taken the initiative.” However, most players don’t really understand what that means, and therefore don’t know how to make use of it in any practical sense. </p>
			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">You will gain huge dividends by creating an “I’ll do what I want no matter what you say” attitude in chess.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">What good is a term, even one that’s constantly used, if its real meaning remains a mystery to the vast majority of chess fans? Because of this, I use that term sparingly, and instead tend to explain a situation where one side succeeds in pushing his agenda with words that can be understood, and that teach. And why not—I consider the initiative to be a physical manifestation of a psychological battle; both sides champion their view of things in the hope that the opponent will have to eventually forgo his own plans and react to yours. Make no mistake about it, macho chess—pushing one’s own agenda and mantras such as “rubbish”, “I will find a way”, “I must” and “I’ll do what I want no matter what you say”—is all about the initiative, and a player’s ability and desire to take iron control over a game!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The following game, played online at a slow time control by Mr. Hubbard (a skilled positional player) and Mr. Abraham (a man who obviously enjoyed a good slugfest), caught my attention in a big way. On move eight White played to make castling difficult for his opponent to achieve. Instead of backing down, Black punched right back, trying to impose his will on White! Though Black was outplayed, we have to salute his “glass overflowing at all times” attitude.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8.Qd4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White obviously felt that Black, with his King sitting in the center, needed to be punished. Though this isn’t by any means the only move, I would never criticize a student for trying to impose his will on the opponent! Of course, both 8.c4 and 8.Bb2 were good alternatives.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s a quick look at 8.Bb2 and the kind of slow but effective positional play that might result: 8…Nxf3+ (8…d6 9.Nxe5 dxe5 10.Nd2 with the idea of Nc4 is good for White) 9.exf3! d5 10.Re1 Be6 11.Nc3 Bg7 12.Ne2! (The Knight prepares to maneuver to e6 when black’s pawn structure will be permanently inferior to white’s) 12…0-0 13.Nd4 Rae8 14.Bh3 Qd6 15.Nxe6 fxe6 16.Be5 and white’s control over the e5-square and pressure against e6 guarantee a nice plus.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">You don’t have to go berserk trying to knock a guy out! Yes, if the opportunity arises, take it, but in most cases calmly pushing your positional/tactical agenda in a logical fashion will get the job done. “Macho chess” should also be logical, imbalance-oriented chess!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…d6 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">8…Nxf3+!? was a good alternative.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9.Rd1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">9.Nxe5!? was also possible, but 9.Rd1 continues white’s efforts to make his opponent bend to his will. Now d6 is under pressure and 9…Bg7 is impossible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Bg7!? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Maybe it’s not impossible after all! Black refuses to obey and offers up the d-pawn in an act of commendable defiance. Instead, 9…Nxf3+!? was interesting: 10.Bxf3 Bg7 11.c3 0-0 12.Qxd6 Qxd6 13.Rxd6 Bf5 14.Be3 Rfe8 with compensation for the sacrificed pawn.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10.Nxe5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">10.Qxd6?? Qxd6 11.Rxd6 Ne4 would have led to some horrible blow along the a1-h8 diagonal. However, after 10.Nxe5 it’s <span class="italic">clear</span> that Black has two possible moves: 10…dxe5 and 10…Qxe5—White would retain some advantage in both cases.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 183</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">10…Nd7!?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I said Black had “two possible moves” and he tossed out a third! The move is a blunder, but I have to admire this guy’s spirit! He refuses to be bullied, even if it means committing ritualistic seppuku. “I can’t” or “I have to” doesn’t exist in Mr. Abraham’s vocabulary!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At this point White had to make a big decision: back off and settle for a small plus, or put his brain into hyper-drive and insist on finding something crushing. In the actual game, Mr. Hubbard couldn’t deal with the heat down the a1-h8 diagonal—he blinked, unconsciously muttered, “I can’t refute your move” and then played 11.c3. There followed 11…Bxe5 (11…dxe5 12.Qe3 0-0 13.Ba3 forces Black to give up the d5-square by 13…c5 when 14.c4 followed by Nc3 is very strong for White) 12.Qd2 Nb6? (The beginning of the end. Best was 12…Nc5, but 12…d5 is inferior: 13.Ba3 Bd6 14.Bxd6 Qxd6 15.c4 or 13…Nc5 14.Bxd5!) 13.Ba3 c5? 14.f4 Bf6 15.Qxd6 Qxe2 16.Bxc5 Bg4 17.Qxf6?! (Far stronger was 17.Bc6+!! bxc6 18.Qxc6+ Bd7 19.Qxf6 Qxd1+ 20.Kf2 Qc2+ 21.Nd2 Qxd2+ 22.Kg1 and it’s all over.) 17…Qxd1+ 18.Bf1 Rg8 (18…Kd7 also lost to 19.c4 Rhe8 20.Nc3 Qxa1 21.Qd6+ Kc8 22.Bxb6 axb6 23.Nb5) 19.Qe7 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Though “death by diagonal” seems to be staring you in the face (with all sorts of “I can’t and “I must” thoughts zipping through your neurons), White can punish his opponent’s hubristic 10…Nd7 only by staring down the barrel of the diagonal gun: <span class="bold">11.Nxc6! Bxd4 12.Nxe7 Bxa1</span> and, after a few forced moves, we come to a split:</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Finding the refutation to black’s outrageous 10…Nd7 called for a certain attitude, the determination of a wronged man, and more than a little courage. If you begin with “I can’t” or any kind of fear, then the mental/emotional battle is over before it begins.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Here’s a simpler (and amusing!) example of a blitz game where White gives his opponent a tiny push, and Black responds by running him over.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">However, White felt that he might as well attack black’s Queen with his Rook and get a “free” move in.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">13…cxb3! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Why move the Queen when Black can make his own threats instead?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14.c4? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">One can imagine White thinking, “Okay, <span class="italic">now</span> move your Queen!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">14…Bxc4!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black’s verbal reply would go something like, “Me, move my Queen and do what you want me to do? No way!” With 14…Bxc4, Black still ignores his opponent while feasting on white bits. This is even stronger than 14…bxa2, which was played in the actual game (Black won in 19 moves). </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Qe1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White: “Okay, now you simply <span class="italic">must</span> move that Queen!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Better (but still bad) was 15.Rxd8 Bxe2 16.Rxa8 Rxa8 17.axb3 (17.Rxb3 Bd1) 17…Bd3 18.Ra1 Bxe4 and black’s two extra pawns and two Bishops should make the win easy.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…bxa2!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black: “Why move my Queen when there are pawns to eat and egos to shred?” </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">16.Ra1 Qb8</span> and, with this move, we once again enter the reality where Queens have to move when they are attacked. Sadly for White, it’s not a very happy reality at all—he’s three pawns down and completely lost.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">As is always the case, these ideas affect players of every level. Our next game shows two legends having at it, with the ever-aggressive Marshall asking Capablanca how he intends to defend d3 (a “you have to” moment).</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Will Capablanca obey Marshall and defend d3? Of course not! He didn’t become an unbeatable chess machine by hysterically catering to his opponent’s whims.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15.Ne4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Naturally, Capablanca doesn’t buy into his opponent’s dictates. Instead he ignores the hanging d-pawn and creates his own, far more bloodthirsty, threats. Suddenly Black is facing a fearsome attack against his King!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Also crushing was 15.Nxe5 Bxe5 16.Bxc6 bxc6 17.Rxf7 Kxf7 18.Qh5+ Kg8 19.Qxe5 Rd7 20.Rf1 Qd8 21.Ne4 with an overwhelming position.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">15…Qxa2 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So what happened if Black chose to make good on his threat and chop on d3? Let’s see: 15…Nxd3 (Worse is 15…Nxf3+ 16.Qxf3 Bxb2 17.Qxf7+ Kh8 18.Qf8+ mates) 16.Nxf6+ (Even 16.Bxf6 is strong: 16…Nxc1 17.Rxc1 gxf6 18.Nxf6+ Kf8 19.Qb2 Qc7 20.Nxh7+ Kg8 21.Nf6+ Kf8 22.Ne4 and White is winning) 16…gxf6 17.Bxf6 Nxc1 18.Rxc1 Qc7 19.Ng5!

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Another depressing line (from black’s point of view) is 17…fxe5 18.Qh5 Qxb2 19.Qxf7+ Kh8 20.Be4. </p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">Defending d3 and attacking at the same time. 18.Rxf6 and 18.Ra1 were also very strong.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">18…f5 doesn’t offer any hope either: 19.Ra1 Qxb3 20.Bxe5 fxe4 21.Qg4+ Kf8 22.Qg7+ Ke8 23.Qxf7 mate. </p>

However, he pointed out that there was no reason to sacrifice and risk a miscalculation when he can play a crystal clear (and safe) move like 20.Rfb1 and win with no muss and no fuss.  </p>

			<p class="float-title">philosophy</p>
			<p class="float-text">If your opponent sends a subliminal “you have to” command, challenge it and let him know that the only agenda that’s going to be pushed is yours.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The ability to laugh at your opponent’s threats while also seeking the very best for your own position is a huge one. In fact, let’s up the voltage a bit and change “seeking” to “insisting”! Most players, when faced with a tough decision, spend a couple minutes looking for the perfect move and then, having failed to find it, play something else that doesn’t get the job done. That is <span class="italic">not</span> insisting! Of course, in many positions several different moves will do, but there usually comes a time when one particular move is needed to win or hold life and limb together. In that case, you <span class="italic">must</span> find it!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The following example shows just such a case.</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 188</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s Queen is attacking both the c8-Rook and the a6-pawn. Since losing the Rook would be suicide, losing the a6-pawn appears to be unavoidable. Many players would accept this and most likely draw the game, but the correct mental stance would be to <span class="italic">demand</span> a solution from yourself—“I <span class="italic">must</span> defend both units or create play elsewhere that will sidetrack him! I must!”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Once you realize that this is <span class="italic">the</span> major decision of the game (i.e., you lose back your extra pawn or you retain it), you should be motivated to put every last ounce of energy into finding the solution to your problem. And, if it turns out that there wasn’t a solution to be found, or that the answer was beyond your level, don’t feel bad—as long as you recognized the moment’s importance and tried as hard as you could to solve it, there is no reason not to feel happy with yourself.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In this particular position, Black found the right way to proceed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Qc4! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A nice move that defends a6, defends c8, and also creates a nasty little threat that White completely missed.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.Qxb6?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White snaps while the snapping is good, but this obvious capture loses immediately. White needed to settle down and process all the things that black’s move does. Once he understood that …Qh4+ was a devastating threat, he would be in the same “must find” situation that Black was a moment before. Then it would be up to White to hunker down and find the best way to put up resistance. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White’s assessment of the position’s needs is fairly straightforward: …Qh4+ is a deathblow, and a quiet defensive move like 2.g3 allows Black to consolidate with 2…Rc6 (even better is 2…Qe6 when 3.Qxa6 fails to 3…Qh3) 3.Qb8+ Kg7 4.Qe5+ Rf6. So White needs to avoid the big threat and try and create some counterplay at the same time (since black’s two connected passed queenside pawns will kill him if he fails to do so).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">If White wants counterplay, he needs to get his Rook into the action. Thus 2.Rd2 (which also gives white’s King access to e2 in case of a check on h4) makes a lot of sense. Now 2…Rc6 doesn’t have the desired effect: 3.Qb8+ Kg7 4.Qe5+ Rf6 5.Rd6 Qc2+ 6.Kg3 Qf5 7.Qd4 and White is doing very well. So, after 2.Rd2 Qh4+ is still the best move: 3.Ke2 Re8 4.Qxb6 Qxh2 5.Kf2 Qh4+ 6.Ke2 and though Black is obviously better, White is still hanging on and forcing his opponent to work hard for the win.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">2…Qh4+</span>, 0-1. Clearly, a “must find the best move” mentality in critical positions is useful both in attack and defense.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">At the highest levels of the game, both sides consistently push their own agendas with an unerring singleness of purpose. And, more often than not, when one side “blinks” and accepts that the opponent’s ideas are better than his, the blinker quickly finds his position sliding into oblivion.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black has weaknesses on a5, c5, c6, and c7. However, the pawn on a5 is trying to make a fight of it by threatening b4. Since 17.bxa5? c5 cures Black of his ills, perhaps he’s okay after all?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Nb3!  </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Very nice! By depriving Black of his dreamed of …c7-c5 advance (which would eradicate his weaknesses and free his pieces), White maintains a firm grip on the queenside. White refused to bow to his opponent’s will and instead pressed ahead with his own agenda. However, wouldn’t most players be transfixed by the loss of the b4-pawn? The only way someone can get beyond the “I can’t let him win a pawn” mentality is if they train themselves to see imbalances (like space and control over advanced squares) as being just as important (depending on the position, of course!) as material.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Giving up the b-pawn (whose purpose was to prevent …c7-c5) has given White the time to get his rather unimposing d2-Knight to the hole on c6. This not only strangles Black and forever stops …c7-c5 (the work of the noble b4-pawn continues even in death!), but the a-file will soon open, allowing white’s Rook to enter hostile territory.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sb">The b4-pawn has reincarnated! Looking at this new situation, we can see that White has retained material equality, kept a firm grasp on c5 and c6, and is ready to penetrate along the a-file.

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Make no mistake about it—this kind of strength of mind isn’t just for the elite! You can begin to develop it at any level by training yourself to highlight your position’s favorable imbalances while refusing to cave in to your opponent’s attempts to turn your head to his way of looking at things. This training can be done by studying grandmaster games and getting a feel for the way the chess gods always stress the positive aspects of their game, and/or you can (and should!) practice this in your own games (tournament or blitz!), making sure that every game you play is a live lesson in positive cues like “Rubbish!” “I must find the best move!” “I will make full use of the positive imbalances in my position!” “It’s my party and I’ll do what I want to!” and other nuggets of that nature. Yes, it <span class="italic">will</span> go horribly wrong from time to time, but that’s how you learn. When you get nuked (which is inevitable—it happens to everybody), get up, wipe away the radioactive dust, and try again and again and again.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Even blitz can be a good training ground for mental toughness and pushing your own agenda. In fact, in a quick game a player has to push his agenda on automatic pilot—it has to become as natural as breathing, while reacting eventually becomes something you only do with a very heavy heart.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In diagram 191, Black (who has a good game) threatens both ...Qxe4 and ...Rxb2. How should White react?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16.Rad1! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The kind of move that’s perfect for blitz—good or bad, White is striving to redefine the position on his own terms. Note what is going on: Black was trying to tell White that the loose pawns on b2 and e4 were the factors that really mattered in the position. He wanted White to agree and begin to defend. Instead, White pointed to d6 and insisted that this was more important than b2 and e4. Now it was up to Black to get a grip on the position and find a way to challenge White again.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">16…Qxe4?? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Black immediately cracks by failing to understand the full import of 16.Rad1. Instead, he could have tested White a bit with 16…Ne5 (16…Be6 17.Bxe6 Qxe6 18.b3 Nd4 19.Rfe1 is about equal) 17.Qe2 Nxc4 18.Qxc4 Be6 when Black has slightly the better of it, but the Bishops of opposite colors and the weakness of d6 prevents him from getting more than that. For example 19.Qc3 Bxa2 20.Rd2 Qe6 (and not 20…Qxe4?? 21.Qa5!) 21.Bf4 (both sides logically build up against the other’s weak points) 21…Rfb8 22.Rfd1 and White is fine.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">17.Bd3 Bg4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">17…g6 18.Bxe4 gxh5 19.Rxd6 Bb7 20.Bf6 is also hopeless for Black.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">18.Qh4</span>, 1-0. The fact is, when you keep pushing your stuff, you’ll find that most players just won’t be able to keep up with you!</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-74" class="sub-chapter"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-9"/>Key Positions</h3>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">We’ve all seen notes to a game where the annotator says, “This is the key position.” But, what exactly <span class="italic">is</span> a key position? A key position is, in my view, a very personal thing—while one player might see a particular situation as a key position that demands a huge effort to solve, another will see the same position as easy and thus not important at all. A position is only “key” if you sense that the correct move or plan will have a major impact on the game, but the right move or plan isn’t clear to you.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Of course, this takes us back to mental toughness and the mindset of insisting on solving an over-the-board problem that you deem important. Semantics isn’t important during a heated battle, though understanding the concept of a “key position” can be useful when it’s brought up in various books or by other players who are trying to define a position in some way.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Typical examples of situations that could easily be labeled “key” are:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A sharp/tactical position that must be solved or you will be drowned. </p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A position that you feel should be a win or at least advantageous, but proving that feeling seems far from easy. If your gut tells you there’s something nice lurking in the shadows, take the time to find it.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>A quiet position that’s in need of a plan or (at least) a series of logical moves that address the imbalances. If you don’t know what that plan is, if you can’t lecture about the imbalances, then <span class="italic">why are you moving</span>?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Let’s look at examples of each of these scenarios.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="underlined">FIRST</span>—A sharp/tactical position that must be solved or you go under and never come back up:</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 192</p>
			<div class="_idgenobjectlayout">
				<div class="diagram-os">
					<img class="_idgenpageitem1" src="../images/00194.jpeg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="_idTOCAnchor-1"/><a id="St.-Novikov---A.-Korotylev--60th-Russian-Champ-2007"/><a id="Smallville--H.-Nakamura----Erebuni--ICC-2009"/>Smallville (H. Nakamura) - Erebuni, ICC 2009<br class="calibre3"/>White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This occurred in a 3-0 blitz game. Here we have an extremely sharp position. White has two Bishops vs. two Knights and possible tactics against black’s King. On the other hand, Black is two pawns ahead, is threatening to exchange Queens (which would end white’s attack), and is also threatening to rid himself of that attacking f6-pawn by …Nxf6 or …Qxf6.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White must find something special here or he’ll lose. For many players, this would be considered a key position since it’s do or die—they have to search long and hard for a miracle since anything less is fatal. For Nakamura it’s not a key position because the solution was obvious to him (it held no secrets) and was played in an instant:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.Qxe6!!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Black didn’t expect this! Now the tables have completely turned and Erebuni finds himself in his own key position (very few players would be able to easily absorb the nuances of this position)—unfortunately, he has no time! And, with his final seconds ticking away, he must find a defense or lose.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game he failed to put up any resistance and quickly got mated after 1…Ncd6?? (now it’s over) 2.Qe7 Nxb7 3.Qf8 mate. Also unpalatable is 1…Qxf6 2.Qxc4 Qa1+ 3.Kh2 Nd6 4.Qxc5 Nxb7 5.Bxb7 Qd4 6.Qc2 when the two mighty Bishops and the weak dark-squares around black’s King leave the second player with an unenviable defensive task.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">In a game with a long time control, Black would sit and look for that hidden way out. It might not be there, but then you would almost certainly lose. So, since you have no choice, tell yourself that there <span class="italic">is</span> a defense and spare no effort in unearthing it! As it turns out, Black has one way and one way only to sure salvation:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…Ne5! 2.Qe7 Qd1+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">An alternative is 2…Qd6, but if ultimately fails: 3.Bd5 Qxe7 4.fxe7 Rxd5 (4…Rd7 5.Rxd7 Nxd7 6.Bc6 Ndf6 7.Bf4 is grim for Black—the two Bishops and the monster passed e-pawn will overwhelm him) 5.Rb8 f6 6.Rxe8+ Kf7 7.Rd8 Nf3+ 8.Kg2 Ne1+ 9.Kf1 Re5 10.e8=Q+ Rxe8 11.Rxe8 Kxe8 12.Kxe1 and White wins.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3.Bf1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">3.Kh2?? loses to 3…Ng4+.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Nf3+! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Clearly best. Also possible is 3…Qd6, when after 4.Rxa7 c4 5.Qxd6 Nxd6 6.Bf4 black’s position is unpleasant but perhaps defensible.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">4.Kg2 Nxh4+!</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The only move since 4…Ne1+?? 5.Kh3 is game over.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5.gxh4 Qg4+</span> and Black draws by perpetual check.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="underlined">SECOND</span>—A position that you feel should be a win or at least advantageous, but proving that feeling seems far from easy. If your gut tells you there’s something nice lurking in the shadows, take the time to find it:</p>
			<div class="nobreak"><p class="diagram-number-sb">Diagram 193</p>

			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold"><a id="J.-Sunye---J.-Nunn--Amsterdam-1985"/>J. Sunye - J. Nunn, Amsterdam 1985<br class="calibre3"/>Black to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White is a pawn up, but it’s clear that b4 will fall. Once that happens White will have the better pawn structure but Black will enjoy a safer King, two Bishops, and (thanks to his lead in development) a bothersome initiative.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Because of these facts, Nunn felt that the position should offer him a serious advantage. However, feeling that and proving it are two very different things. For example, Grandmaster Nigel Davies gives the following line: 1…Bf5 2.Rb3 Rxb4 3.Rxb4 Rxb4 4.Bxd5 Rb1+ 5.Kg2 Be4+ 6.Bxe4 Qxe4+ 7.Kh2 “followed by Qe2 when White survives.”</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">So we have a key position—Nunn thinks he’s much better, but if he wants to prove it his next move is critical. I have no way of knowing how much time Black took for this decision, but you can be sure he didn’t take it lightly and refused to move until he was completely happy with the move he deemed best.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Of course, all that effort doesn’t guarantee success, and sometimes you’ll find that your position wasn’t as good as you had hoped, while other times you’ll simply fail to find the right idea. Nevertheless, building this kind of “I must find it!” habit will serve you well in the vast majority of situations.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1…c5!?  </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Not your everyday move, so this might have been a bit of a shock to White. Black gets rid of his long-term pawn weakness on c7 and also opens the position up for the dark-squared Bishop. All very logical and creative, but this also leaves d5 weak and that plays a big part in white’s defensive hopes later in the game. Perhaps it would have been better to retain as much tension as possible by 1…c6 (making sure d5 won’t ever be a problem) 2.Bf3 Bf5 3.Rb2 Rxb4 4.Rxb4 Rxb4 5.Kg2 Rc4! 6.Ne2 Rc2 7.Qd1 Bh6 8.Rf1 (8.Re1?? Bxe3!) 8…Kh7 9.Kh1 Qa3 and White’s under a lot of pressure.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Whether 1…c5 is best or whether 1…c6 was the move, Nunn’s choice sparks the position and forces his opponent to solve difficult problems if he wishes to achieve his best possible result—a draw. Pressure on the opponent and a two-result game (win or draw) is always a good thing!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">2.dxc5 Qxc5 3.Bf3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">And not 3.bxc5?? Rxb1+ 4.Qe1 Rxe1+ 5.Kxe1 Bc3+ 6.Kf1 Rb1 mate.  </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">3…Rxb4 4.Rxb4 Rxb4 5.Qxd5 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">There goes d5! Now White is a pawn up but his pieces are still hemmed in and his King is insecure.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">5…Rb1+ 6.Kg2 Qc1 7.Kh2? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A mistake. White should have played 7.Qd3! when 7…Bf5 8.e4 Be6 9.Kh2 Rb3 still leaves Black with some pressure, but one would expect that White has sufficient defensive resources to hold the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">7…Qf1 8.Bg2? </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">White is definitely losing after this. Like it or not, White had to give up a piece for two pawns by 8.Bxg4 hxg4 9.Qg2 Qa6 10.Nh3 gxh3 11.Kxh3 and then hang on for dear life.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">8…Qxf2 9.Nh3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">No better is 9.Qe4 Rc1 10.Qf4 Qb2 11.Nf3 Rc2 12.Ne1 Re2 13.Rg1 Be5 and white’s stuff will begin to fall.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">9…Rxh1+ 10.Kxh1 Bxh3 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">10…Qxg3 might be even more accurate, but who can argue with something that makes the opponent resign a couple moves later?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">11.Bxh3 Qxg3</span>, 0-1.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="underlined">THIRD</span>—A quiet position that’s in need of a plan or (at least) a series of logical moves that address the imbalances.

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="caption1"><span class="bold">White to move</span></p></div>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White has an absolutely wonderful position here—she’s ahead in development, her pieces are active, and black’s Queen is vulnerable to attack. There’s no winning tactic, so White needs to take a long think and find a plan that takes maximum advantage of the positive imbalances that were just mentioned. For Pam, this is indeed a key position, but a titled player probably wouldn’t consider it to be very challenging.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game, Pam played 15.e4—I tend to label this kind of error as a “lazy move” or “soft move.” My choice depends on which term will have the greatest effect on the particular student—some demand a no-nonsense approach, while others need a gentle hand. In recent chess literature, some authors have referred to these lack-of-effort mistakes as “half moves”—a politically correct term (both “soft move” and “half move” are good choices if you’re teaching children) that lets the reader know that the move doesn’t do as much as it should.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">But why is 15.e4 a lazy move? Pam knew she had a great position, but she didn’t bother taking enough time to really get into its secrets. Instead she felt that gaining space couldn’t be bad and then tossed 15.e4 onto the board (which, by the way, blocks the g2-Bishop’s diagonal). Now, I’m not just picking on Pam here (who kindly allowed me to use quite a few of her very instructive games)! It’s important to shout out that “lazy moves” are played by everyone at every level! Be that as it may, you can do a lot towards lowering the incidents of lazy moves in your own games by catching yourself during key positions or any time you don’t know what to do, and demanding the best effort you can possibly give. Then, if you fail to find a good way to handle the position you can still be proud of yourself—you did your best and nobody can ask more of you than that.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Returning to the position in diagram 194, White wants to get as much value for her many positional plusses as possible. Since black’s Queen is in the line of fire, White should milk that situation by 15.Be3! when the Queen doesn’t have a happy place to move to. Three examples:</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>15…Qc7 16.Nd4! (making immediate use of the pin along the c-file) 16…Bd7 17.Qb3 Qb6 (17…Qc8 18.Rac1 a5 19.Bh3 and Black is lost) 18.Qxb6 axb6 19.Nf5 is very strong.</p>
			<p class="list"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>15…Qa6 16.Ne1! Ne5 (16…e5 17.Be4 f5 18.Bd3 b5 19.Qb3+ wins the b5-pawn) 17.Nd3 Nxd3 (17…Qc4 18.Qc1!—A very accurate move that makes sure the Rooks will protect each other. Also fine is the obvious 18.Rac1, though that gives Black 18…Qxc2 19.Rxc2 Rd8 pinning the Knight to the d1-Rook—18…Qxc1 19.Raxc1 Nxd3 20.Rxd3 a5 21.Bc5 Bxc5 22.Rxc5 and White’s Rooks will penetrate into black’s position) 18.Rxd3 e5 19.Rc1 Be6 20.Qc7 and White wins material.</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span>15…Qa5 16.Nd4 Nxd4 17.Rxd4 e5 (17…Rd8 18.b4 Qe5 19.Rxd8+ Bxd8 20.Rd1 and white’s pieces are raking black’s queenside and both files) 18.Qc4+ Kh8 19.Rd5 (embarrassing black’s Queen) 19…Be6 20.Rxa5 Bxc4 21.Bxb7 Rab8 22.Rxa7 Bxe2 23.a4 and the queenside pawns will win the game.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Notice how these lines kept Black under severe pressure, tormented his Queen, and also allowed White to make full use of the open c- and d-files.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The actual game continued: <span class="bold">15.e4? e5 16.Be3 Qc7 17.Rac1 Be6 18.h3? </span>Another lazy move, and now white’s advantage is more or less gone (18.Bf1 followed by Bc4, trading the bad Bishop on g2 for the extremely active enemy Bishop on e6, was a much stronger idea). The further course of the battle had many ebbs and flows, with White once again obtaining a winning position only to blunder and actually lose: <span class="bold">18…Rfd8 19.Bf1 Rxd1 20.Rxd1 Rd8 21.Rd2 Rxd2 22.Nxd2 Qc8 23.Kh2 g6 24.Bc4 Kg7 25.Bxe6 Qxe6 26.Qc4 Qxc4 27.Nxc4 b5 28.Nd2 Kf7 29.Kg2 a5 30.Kf1 Ke6 31.Ke2 Bd6 32.Kd3 h5 33.Bb6 f5 34.Nf3 Kf6 35.Ne1 f4 36.Nf3 g5 37.g4 hxg4 38.hxg4 Be7 39.Ng1 Ke6 40.Ne2 b4 41.a4 Kd6 42.Kc4 Bd8 43.Bxd8 Nxd8 44.Nc1 Nc6 45.Nb3 f3 46.Kb5? </span>(Both 46.Kd3 followed by Ke3 and Kxf3, or 46.Nc5 would have been extremely good for white) <span class="bold">46…Nd4+ 47.Nxd4 exd4 48.Kc4 Ke5 49.Kd3 b3 50.Kc4 Kxe4 51.Kxb3 Kd3 52.Ka3 Kc2</span>, 0-1. “Lazy Moves” and “Soft Moves” will be explored in greater detail in the next chapter, Various States of Chess Consciousness.</p>
