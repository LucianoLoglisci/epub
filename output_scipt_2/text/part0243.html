			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White (who was conducting a clock simultaneous exhibition) has an obvious lead in development and black’s King is in the center. The position screams for immediate dynamic play—otherwise Black will consolidate with …Ne7 and …0-0 when her queenside play will offer good chances.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: The spread is large since different rating groups will show different levels of depth regarding the answer. Players in the 1600 range should notice the central King and white’s lead in development. I would be very proud of any 1600 student who noticed these factors and played 14.a4 (trying to open things up). White’s best moves, though, are far harder to find and call for players in the “A” and Expert categories. I’m not expecting you to find the tactics that follow (just seeing the logic of moves such as 14.a4, 14.b4, or 14.Nb3 is good enough), but those who did are surely title-strength players.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the actual game, White didn’t show a very good sense of Target Consciousness and played the quiet 14.Nf1? when the following occurred: 14…Ne7 15.Ng3 Bg6 16.Bd3 0–0 17.Qe2 Bf7? (Both 17…Bxd3 18.Qxd3 Ng6 and 17…Rfe8 gave Black an excellent position) 18.Qc2 Bg6 19.Nh4 Bxd3 20.Qxd3 Rae8 21.Nf3 (21.a4! was better for White), 1/2-1/2.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">It’s clear that 14.Nf1 has nothing whatsoever to do with the position. So what should White play? There were actually a few interesting tries, but we’ll only look at three (all of them begin an immediate fight!):</p>
			<p class="list-1-last"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">»</span><span class="bold">14.a4 b4 15.Nh4 Ne7 16.Nxf5 Nxf5 17.Bg4 0–0 18.Qe2 bxc3 19.bxc3 Rfe8 20.Bxf5 exf5 21.Qxe8+ Rxe8 22.Rxe8+ Kf7 23.Rae1 Nb7</span> and it’s not clear if White has anything here since his queenside pawns are easy pickings for the Queen. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">After <span class="bold">14.a4 b4</span>, the insane looking <span class="bold">15.g4</span> is a great illustration for how a player should strive to make use of his positive imbalances—in this case development and a central enemy King demands quick play and energy, so 15.g4 shows the right spirit, though the move doesn’t turn out to be particularly good. Let’s take a look at the move’s point: <span class="bold">15…Bxg4?</span> (Simple and sane is 15…Bg6 when I’m not sure what White has gained for the weakening of his kingside) <span class="bold">16.cxb4</span></p>

The other Knight retreat, 16…Nc6, also gives White a powerful initiative: 17.b5 Nb4 18.Nh4 Bxe2 19.Qxe2 Kf7 [19…Nc2 20.Nf5 Qd7 21.Nb3 Nxe1 22.Nc5 gives White a winning attack] 20.Nb3) <span class="bold">17.Nh4 Bf5 18.Nxf5 exf5 19.Bf3+ Ne7 20.Rc1</span> and Black, who is staring Rc7 in the face, is in serious trouble.</p>

Pulling black’s Bishop away from the e4-square so that the d2-Knight can safely land there. Black, with his lack of development and vulnerable King, isn’t prepared for this kind of brutal assault.</p>
