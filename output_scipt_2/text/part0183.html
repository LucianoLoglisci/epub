			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This position might fool some players into thinking that White is okay since black’s Bishop is bad and his Knight doesn’t appear particularly threatening. And doesn’t Black also have the worse pawn structure (three pawn islands to two)? </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">These pro-white ruminations might appear reasonable, except that they fail to take into account black’s pluses and the dynamic possibilities available to him. For instance, Black is placing serious pressure on the f4-pawn and, if either Rook were forced to move away from the pawn’s defense, Black would win a pawn and most likely the game with it. Also note that one of black’s “despised” extra pawn islands is comprised of powerful center pawns, which gain space and take squares and files away from the enemy pieces. Finally, white’s Knight isn’t doing anything. It can’t safely move forward and it won’t be a world-beater if it moves backwards either.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Since white’s f-pawn is under pressure, the first thing Black needs to do is ask if he can increase that pressure or chase one of the defenders away. Since going after f4 right away via …e5 or …g5 fails to achieve anything of significance (White would capture either pawn), that leaves us looking at the other idea of harassing a defender. At the moment, the f3-Rook is solidly guarded and can’t be successfully attacked. The d4-Rook is another matter; it’s obvious that the light b7-Bishop can’t influence the d4-square, but what about black’s Knight? And once you pose that simple question, the correct move is suddenly easy to find.</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: There seems to be a lot going on, so a Knight retreat to b8 most likely wouldn’t occur to anyone under 1800, and could be easily missed by much higher rated players. Nevertheless, I would expect those in the 1800 - 2000 range who have read the earlier material on Knights to come up with the solution.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Nb8! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Winning material by force! Who would have guessed that a Knight retreat would have been so powerful?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Kg1 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The only way to defend the f4-pawn is 23.g3, but that fails badly: 23…e5 24.Rd1 d4 25.Nb1 g5 and white’s position has been run over. Notice that that “bad” light-squared Bishop on b7 has suddenly turned into a seek-and-destroy missile. </p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Nc6 24.Rd1 Rxf4 25.Rxf4 Rxf4 26.g3 Rf6 27.Re1 Nd4 28.Bd1 Kf7 </span>and, with a solid extra pawn, Black eventually won.</p>
