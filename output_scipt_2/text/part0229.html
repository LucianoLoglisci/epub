			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">The move played in the game was 40…f6?, which is a mistake (The finish was 41.Rxe5 fxe5 42.Qxe5+ Kg8 43.Rb4 Qh1+ 44.Kf2 Rf7 45.Rb8?? [45.Kxg3 would have won.] 45…Rxb8 46.Qxb8+ Kg7 47.Qe5+ Kf8 48.Qb8+ Kg7 49.Qe5+, 1/2-1/2.). Alekhine (who annotated all the games in this event in the classic tournament book) had this to say: “Here, however, he falters when almost near the goal and in so doing exposes himself to the danger of losing. With 40…Rd5 41.Qb6 cxb5 42.Qxc7 Qd4+ (not 42…Nxf5 at once, on account of 43.Re4) 43.Kh2 Nxf5 44.Re4 (If 44.Bxf5, mate follows in four moves) 44…Qc5, the game, thanks to two extra pawns, would have been easily won for Black.”</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: I think a 1400 can follow those two moves in his head, but that’s where the fun begins! The illusion that follows can easily affect players of all strengths.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Did you, after 40…Rd5 41.Qb6 cxb5, also go on autopilot and snap off the c7-Rook with 42.Qxc7?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">It turns out that Alekhine’s analysis is a complete mess. However, let’s just concentrate on the position after 40…Rd5 41.Qb6 cxb5?? - see diagram 179a</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">I think a lot of readers would play 42.Qxc7?? and then try to assess the resulting position. Both 41…cxb5 and 42.Qxc7 were taken for granted by Alekhine, yet both are extreme blunders—41…cxb5?? allows a mate in four by 42.f6+ Kf8 43.Qb8+, and 42.Qxc7?? misses the mate entirely. How could one of the greatest players, and greatest calculators, of all time have made such mistakes? Well, he did worship the god Bacchus, so I suppose that inebriation could be given as an excuse. And he was also known to write a lot of his material without use of a board (he did the analysis in his head and then just wrote it down). But my theory is far simpler: he was a victim of “He has to” or “He must” (as in, “Black has to take on b5 and then White has to take on c7.”). Once you get into that mindset, you simply continue with it—thus the first “Black has to take” led effortlessly to the “and White has to recapture” that followed.</p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">This brings us to an excellent training recommendation: After playing in an event, sit down and annotate all your games in depth. Don’t only input the moves! Also write down why you played them, why you made all your decisions (plus write down why you felt your opponent made his choices). <span class="italic">Don’t</span> use an engine until <span class="italic">after</span> you finish your analysis! Once your notes are complete, use an engine (or go over them with your chess teacher). You might be surprised to find that you fell victim to “I can’t” or “He had to” over and over again. Once you see this happening in your own games, you personalize the problem and can then begin the process of rectifying it.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">To finish up, Alekhine was right about 40…Rd5, but after 41.Qb6 Black had to play 41…Rxb5! 42.Bxb5 Qd4+ 43.Qxd4 exd4 44.Bxa4 Nxf5 and White would be in serious trouble.</p>
