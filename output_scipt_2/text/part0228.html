			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 0–0 5.Bg5 c5 6.e3 cxd4 7.exd4 h6 8.Bh4 d5 9.Rc1 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Nc6 11.0–0 Be7 12.Re1 b6 13.a3 Bb7 14.Bg3 Rc8 15.Ba2 Bd6 16.d5 Nxd5 17.Nxd5 Bxg3 18.hxg3 exd5 19.Bxd5 Qf6 20.Qa4 Rfd8 21.Rcd1 Rd7 22.Qg4 </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">White threatens the d7-Rook, but why not end that threat and make a threat of your own at the same time? It’s hard to argue with that logic, and 22…Rcd8 is as natural a move as one will ever see. However, it also involves one of our brain melting phrases: “He can’t” (as in, “After I defend my Rook he can’t take it.”). The fact is that personal announcements that stop the thinking process and the process of proving an assertion are one of the main causes of tactical oversights. Yes, 22…Rcd8 makes perfect sense—<span class="italic">if it works</span>!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Whenever you notice tactical red flags in your position (in this case White has more active pieces, there are some back rank considerations, f7 is under pressure, d7 is hanging, and b7 is undefended) it’s critical to prove any move you choose is good not just logically or strategically, but also tactically! These red flags demand that you make a bit more effort than usual in guarding against some hidden unpleasantness.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">In the game Karpov decided 22…Rcd8 was not only the most logical move in the position, but that it also held up tactically. For example, 23.Re8+ (trying to make use of black’s delicate back rank) 23…Rxe8 24.Qxd7 (attacking b7 and e8 at the same time) fails to 24…Re7. Unfortunately, 22…Rcd8 turned out to be one of the biggest blunders of his career! - Diagram 178</p>
			<p class="indent-left-p"><span class="bold-underlined">Explaining the Rating Spread</span>: A tricky tactic that even a World Champion missed? Perhaps I’m way off on the rating spread, and a 2000 player can’t be expected to spot the danger?</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Rcd8 23.Qxd7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">A different (this time effective!) way to punish black’s back rank weakness and the loose b7-Bishop.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23…Rxd7 24.Re8+ Kh7 25.Be4+</span>, 1-0. The problem isn’t just that White has two Rooks for a Queen, but he’s also winning a black minor piece by force after 25…g6 26.Rxd7 Ba6 27.Bxc6 since 27…Qxc6 falls victim to 28.Rxf7 mate.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">So was Black in trouble in diagram 178? No, he had pretty much equalized. If he had noticed the flaw in his 22…Rcd8, he would surely have found:</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">22…Rd6! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text">Battening down the hatches! Now the Queen defends d6, everything seems to be defending c6, and …Rcd8 is once again “on” (but this time safe).</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I should point out that 22…Re7? gets hammered due to the previously mentioned problems with f7 and b7: 23.Rxe7 Qxe7 24.Bxf7+! Qxf7 25.Rd7. This once again illustrates the tactical pitfalls lurking in the position and the care that was needed to avoid them!</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">23.Ba2</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">The solidity of black’s position can be seen after 23.Re4 (threatening to slice and dice f7 with Rf4) 23…Rf8! 24.Rf4 Qd8 and all is well.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text"><span class="bold">23…Rcd8 24.Rxd6 Rxd6 </span></p>

			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25.Re8+</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">I give this to illustrate one last try by White to milk the back rank. Quieter moves like 25.Qe4 just lead to equality: 25…g6 26.b4 Kg7 27.Bd5 Qd8, =.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">25…Kh7 26.Qe4+ g6 27.Bd5 Kg7 28.b4 Rd7 29.Rg8+ </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Hoping for 29…Kxg8? 30.Qe8+ followed by 31.Qxd7.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">29…Kh7! </span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">Now …Rxd5 followed by …Kxg8 is threatened, so the Rook has to admit that its adventure has led to nothing.</p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa"><span class="bold">30.Rf8</span></p>
			<p class="firstline-indent-basic-text-sa">30.Re8 Nd8, =.</p>
